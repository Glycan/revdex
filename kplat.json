It is difficult to know how to  \napproach it. What do you do with a book that dedicates an entire chapter to  \nmusic and animal behavior\u2014and then claims that it isn't a chapter? That  \npresents itself as a network of \"plateaus\" that are precisely dated, but can  \nbe read in any order? That deploys a complex technical vocabulary drawn  \nfrom a wide range of disciplines in the sciences, mathematics, and the  \nhumanities, but whose authors recommend that you read it as you would  \nlisten to a record?\n\n1\n\n\"Philosophy, nothing but philosophy.\"\n\n2\n\nOf a bastard line.\n\nThe annals of official philosophy are populated by \"bureaucrats of pure\n\nreason\" who speak in \"the shadow of the despot\" and are in historical com-  \nplicity with the State.\n\n3\n\nThey invent \"a properly spiritual... absolute State that\n\n... effectively functions in the mind.\" Theirs is the discourse of sovereign  \njudgment, of stable subjectivity legislated by \"good\" sense, of rocklike iden-  \ntity, \"universal\" truth, and (white male) justice. \"Thus the exercise of their  \nthought is in conformity with the aims of the real State, with the dominant\nsig-  \nnifications, and with the requirements of the established order.\"\n\n4\n\nGilles Deleuze was schooled in that philosophy. The titles of his earliest\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)011.png)\n\nx\n\n\u25a1 TRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD\n\nbooks read like a Who's Who of philosophical giants. \"What got me by dur-\n\ning that period was conceiving of the history of philosophy as a kind of\n\nass-fuck, or, what amounts to the same thing, an immaculate conception.\n\nI imagined myself approaching an author from behind and giving him a child\n\nthat would indeed be his but would nonetheless be monstrous.\"\n\n5\n\nHegel is\n\nabsent, being too despicable to merit even a mutant offspring.\n\n6\n\nTo Kant he\n\ndedicated an affectionate study of \"an enemy.\" Yet much of positive value\n\ncame of Deleuze's flirtation with the greats. He discovered an orphan line of\n\nthinkers who were tied by no direct descendance but were united in their\n\nopposition to the State philosophy that would nevertheless accord them\n\nminor positions in its canon. Between Lucretius, Hume, Spinoza,\n\nNietzsche, and Bergson there exists a \"secret link constituted by the critique\n\nof negativity, the cultivation of joy, the hatred of interiority, the\nexteriority of\n\nforces and relations, the denunciation of power.\"\n\n7\n\nDeleuze's first major\n\nstatements written in his own voice, _Difference et repetition _(1968) and  \n_Logique du sens _(1969), cross-fertilized that line of \"nomad\" thought with\n\ncontemporary theory. The ferment of the student-worker revolt of May 1968\n\nand the reassessment it prompted of the role of the intellectual in society\n\n8\n\nled\n\nhim to disclaim the \"ponderous academic apparatus\"\n\n9\n\nstill in evidence in\n\nthose works. However, many elements of the \"philosophy of difference\" they\n\nelaborated were transfused into a continuing collaboration, of which _A  \nThousand Plateaus _is the most recent product.\n\nFelix Guattari is a practicing psychoanalyst and lifelong political activ-\n\nist. He has worked since the mid-1950s at La Borde, an experimental psy-\n\nchiatric clinic founded by Lacanian analyst Jean Oury. Guattari himself\n\nwas among Lacan's earliest trainees, and although he never severed his ties\n\nwith Lacan's Freudian School the group therapy practiced at La Borde\n\ntook him in a very different direction. The aim at La Borde was to abolish\n\nthe hierarchy between doctor and patient in favor of an interactive group\n\ndynamic that would bring the experiences of both to full expression in such\n\na way as to produce a collective critique of the power relations in society as\n\na whole. \"The central perspective is... to promote human relations that do\n\nnot automatically fall into roles or stereotypes but open onto fundamental\n\nrelations of a metaphysical kind that _bring out _the most radical and basic\n\nalienations of madness or neurosis\"\n\n10\n\nand channel them into revolutionary\n\npractice. Guattari collaborated beginning in 1960 on group projects dedi-\n\ncated to developing this radical \"institutional psychotherapy,\"\n\n11\n\nand later\n\nentered an uneasy alliance with the international antipsychiatry move-\n\nment spearheaded by R.D. Laing in England and Franco Basaglia in Italy.\n\n12\n\nAs Lacanian schools of psychoanalysis gained ground against psychiatry,\n\nthe contractual Oedipal relationship between the analyst and the transfer-\n\nence-bound analysand became as much of a target for Guattari as the legal\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)012.png)\n\nT\n\nRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD D xi\n\nbondage of the institutionalized patient in the conventional State hospital.\n\nHe came to occupy the same position in relation to psychoanalysis as he\n\nhad all along in relation to the parties of the left: an ultra-opposition\nwithin\n\nthe opposition. His antihierarchical leanings made him a precursor to the\n\nevents of May 1968 and an early partisan of the social movements that\n\ngrew from them, including feminism and the gay rights movement.\n\n_l}_\n\n_ _\n\n_Anti-Oedipus _(1972),\n\nu\n\nhis first book with Deleuze, gave philosophical\n\nweight to his convictions and created one of the intellectual sensations of\n\npostwar France with its spirited polemics against State-happy or pro-party\n\nversions of Marxism and school-building strains of psychoanalysis,\n\nwhich separately and in various combinations represented the dominant\n\nintellectual currents of the time (in spite of the fundamentally anarchist\n\nnature of the spontaneous popular uprisings that had shaken the world in\n\n1968). \"The most tangible result of _Anti-Oedipus _was that it short-circuited\n\nthe connection between psychoanalysis and the far left parties,\" in which\n\nhe and Deleuze saw the potential for a powerful new bureaucracy of\n\nanalytic reason.\n\n15\n\nFor many French intellectuals, the hyperactivism of post-May gave way\n\nto a mid-seventies slump, then a return to religion _(Tel Quel) _or political\n\nconservatism (the Nouveaux Philosophes) in a foreshadowing of the\n\nReagan eighties. Deleuze and Guattari never recanted. Nor did they sim-\n\nply revive the polemics. _A Thousand Plateaus _(1980), written over a\n\nseven-year period, was billed as a sequel to _Anti-Oedipus _and shares its\n\nsubtitle, _Capitalism and Schizophrenia. _But it constitutes a very different\n\nproject. It is less a critique than a positive exercise in the affirmative\n\n\"nomad\" thought called for in _Anti-Oedipus._\n\n\"State philosophy\" is another word for the representational thinking\n\nthat has characterized Western metaphysics since Plato, but has suffered\n\nan at least momentary setback during the last quarter century at the hands\n\nof Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and poststructuralist theory gener-\n\nally. As described by Deleuze,\n\n16\n\nit reposes on a double identity: of the thinking\n\nsubject, and of the concepts it creates and to which it lends its own\n\npresumed attributes of sameness and constancy. The subject, its concepts,\n\nand also the objects in the world to which the concepts are applied have a\n\nshared, internal essence: the self-resemblance at the basis of identity. Rep-\n\nresentational thought is analogical; its concern is to establish a correspon-\n\ndence between these symmetrically structured domains. The faculty of\n\njudgment is the policeman of analogy, assuring that each of the three terms\n\nis honestly itself, and that the proper correspondences obtain. In thought\n\nits end is truth, in action justice.

The modus operandi is negation: _x = x = noty. _Iden-\n\ntity, resemblance, truth, justice, and negation. The rational foundation for\n\norder. The established order, of course: philosophers have traditionally\n\nbeen employees of the State. The collusion between philosophy and the\n\nState was most explicitly enacted in the first decade of the nineteenth cen-\n\ntury with the foundation of the University of Berlin, which was to become\n\nthe model for higher learning throughout Europe and in the United States.\n\nThe goal laid out for it by Wilhelm von Humboldt (based on proposals by\n\nFichte and Schleiermacher) was the \"spiritual and moral training of the\n\nnation,\" to be achieved by \"deriving everything from an original principle\"\n\n(truth), by \"relating everything to an ideal\" (justice), and by \"unifying this\n\nprinciple and this ideal in a single Idea\" (the State). The end product would\n\nbe \"a fully legitimated subject of knowledge and society\"\n\n17\n\n\u2014each mind an\n\nanalogously organized mini-State morally unified in the supermind of the\n\nState. Prussian mind-meld.\n\n18\n\nMore insidious than the well-known practi-\n\ncal cooperation between university and government (the burgeoning mili-\n\ntary funding of research) is its philosophical role in the propagation of the\n\nform of representational thinking itself, that \"properly spiritual absolute\n\nState\" endlessly reproduced and disseminated at every level of the social\n\nfabric. Deconstruction-influenced feminists such as Helene Cixous and\n\nLuce Irigaray have attacked it under the name \"phallogocentrism\" (what\n\nthe most privileged model of rocklike identity is goes without saying). In\n\nthe introduction to _A Thousand Plateaus, _Deleuze and Guattari describe it\n\nas the \"arborescent model\" of thought (the proudly erect tree under whose\n\nspreading boughs latter-day Platos conduct their class).\n\n\"Nomad thought\" does not immure itself in the edifice of an ordered\n\ninteriority; it moves freely in an element of exteriority. It does not repose\n\non identity; it rides difference. It does not respect the artificial division\n\nbetween the three domains of representation, subject, concept, and being;\n\nit replaces restrictive analogy with a conductivity that knows no bounds.\n\nThe concepts it creates do not merely reflect the eternal form of a legislat-\n\ning subject, but are defined by a communicable force in relation to which\n\ntheir subject, to the extent that they can be said to have one, is only secon-\n\ndary. They do not reflect upon the world but are immersed in a changing\n\nstate of things. A concept is a brick. It can be used to build the courthouse\nof\n\nreason. Or it can be thrown through the window. What is the subject of the\n\nbrick? The arm that throws it? The body connected to the arm? The brain\n\nencased in the body? The situation that brought brain and body to such a\n\njuncture? All and none of the above. What is its object? The window? The\n\nedifice? The laws the edifice shelters? The class and other power relations\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)014.png)\n\nTRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD \u25a1 xiii\n\nencrusted in the laws? All and none of the above. \"What interests us are the\n\ncircumstances.\"\n\n19\n\nBecause the concept in its unrestrained usage _is _a set of\n\ncircumstances, at a volatile juncture. It is a vector: the point of\napplication\n\nof a force moving through a space at a given velocity in a given direction.\n\nThe concept has no subject or object other than itself. It is an act. Nomad\n\nthought replaces the closed equation of representation, _x = x = noty _(I = I\n\n= not you) with an open equation: _... + y + z + a + ...(...+ _arm + brick +\n\nwindow + ...). Rather than analyzing the world into discrete components,\n\nreducing their manyness to the One of identity, and ordering them by rank,\n\nit sums up a set of disparate circumstances in a shattering blow. It synthe-\n\nsizes a multiplicity of elements without effacing their heterogeneity or hin-\n\ndering their potential for future rearranging (to the contrary). The modus\n\noperandi of nomad thought is affirmation, even when its apparent object is\n\nnegative. Force is not to be confused with power. Force arrives from outside\n\nto break constraints and open new vistas. Power builds walls.\n\nThe space of nomad thought is qualitatively different from State space.\n\nAir against earth. State space is \"striated,\" or gridded. Movement in it is\n\nconfined as by gravity to a horizontal plane, and limited by the order of\n\nthat plane to preset paths between fixed and identifiable points. Nomad\n\nspace is \"smooth,\" or open-ended. One can rise up at any point and move\n\nto any other. Its mode of distribution is the _nomos: _arraying oneself in an\n\nopen space (hold the street), as opposed to the _logos _of entrenching oneself\n\nin a closed space (hold the fort).\n\n_A Thousand Plateaus _is an effort to construct a smooth space of\n\nthought. It is not the first such attempt. Like State philosophy, nomad\n\nthought goes by many names. Spinoza called it \"ethics.\" Nietzsche called\n\nit the \"gay science.\" Artaud called it \"crowned anarchy.\" To Maurice\n\nBlanchot, it is the \"space of literature.\" To Foucault, \"outside thought.\"\n\n20\n\nIn this book, Deleuze and Guattari employ the terms \"pragmatics\" and\n\n\"schizoanalysis,\" and in the introduction describe a rhizome network\n\nstrangling the roots of the infamous tree. One of the points of the book is\n\nthat nomad thought is not confined to philosophy. Or that the kind of phi-\n\nlosophy it is comes in many forms. Filmmakers and painters are philo-\n\nsophical thinkers to the extent that they explore the potentials of their\n\nrespective mediums and break away from the beaten paths.\n\n21\n\nOn a strictly\n\nformal level, it is mathematics and music that create the smoothest of the\n\nsmooth spaces.\n\n22\n\nIn fact, Deleuze and Guattari would probably be more\n\ninclined to call philosophy music with content than music a rarefied form\n\nof philosophy.\n\nWhich returns to our opening question. How should _A Thousand Pla-_\n\n_teaus _be played? When you buy a record there are always cuts that leave you\n\ncold. You skip them.

The authors' hope, however, is that elements of\n\nit will stay with a certain number of its readers and will weave into the mel-\n\nody of their everyday lives.\n\nEach \"plateau\" is an orchestration of crashing bricks extracted from a\n\nvariety of disciplinary edifices. They carry traces of their former emplace-\n\nment, which give them a spin defining the arc of their vector. The vectors\n\nare meant to converge at a volatile juncture, but one that is sustained, as an\n\nopen equilibrium of moving parts each with its own trajectory. The word\n\n\"plateau\" comes from an essay by Gregory Bateson on Balinese culture, in\n\nwhich he found a libidinal economy quite different from the West's orgas-\n\nmic orientation.\n\n24\n\nIn Deleuze and Guattari, a plateau is reached when cir-\n\ncumstances combine to bring an activity to a pitch of intensity that is not\n\nautomatically dissipated in a climax. The heightening of energies is sus-\n\ntained long enough to leave a kind of afterimage of its dynamism that can\n\nbe reactivated or injected into other activities, creating a fabric of\nintensive\n\nstates between which any number of connecting routes could exist. Each\n\nsection of _A Thousand Plateaus _tries to combine conceptual bricks in such\n\na way as to construct this kind of intensive state in thought. The way the\n\ncombination is made is an example of what Deleuze and Guattari call\n\nconsistency\u2014not in the sense of a homogeneity, but as a holding together\n\nof disparate elements (also known as a \"style\").\n\n25\n\nA style in this sense, as a\n\ndynamic holding together or mode of composition, is not something lim-\n\nited to writing. Filmmakers, painters, and musicians have their styles,\n\nmathematicians have theirs, rocks have style, and so do tools, and technol-\n\nogies, and historical periods, even\u2014especially\u2014punctual events. Each\n\nsection is dated, because each tries to reconstitute a dynamism that has\n\nexisted in other mediums at other times. The date corresponds to the point\n\nat which that particular dynamism found its purest incarnation in matter,\n\nthe point at which it was freest from interference from other modes and\n\nrose to its highest degree of intensity. That never lasts more than a flash,\n\nbecause the world rarely leaves room for uncommon intensity, being in\n\nlarge measure an entropic trashbin of outworn modes that refuse to die.\n\nSection 12, for example, the \"Treatise on Nomadology,\" is dated 1227\n\nA\n\n.\n\nD\n\n.\n\nbecause that is when the nomad war machine existed for a moment in its\n\npure form on the vacant smooth spaces of the steppes of Inner Asia.\n\nThe reader is invited to follow each section to the plateau that rises from\n\nthe smooth space of its composition, and to move from one plateau to the\n\nnext at pleasure. But it is just as good to ignore the heights.

The authors steal from other disciplines with glee, but they are\n\nmore than happy to return the favor. Deleuze's own image for a concept is\n\nnot a brick, but a \"tool box.\"\n\n26\n\nHe calls his kind of philosophy \"pragmatics\"\n\nbecause its goal is the invention of concepts that do not add up to a system\n\nof belief or an architecture of propositions that you either enter or you\n\ndon't, but instead pack a potential in the way a crowbar in a willing hand\n\nenvelops an energy of prying.\n\nThe best way of all to approach the book is to read it as a challenge: to pry\n\nopen the vacant spaces that would enable you to build your life and those of\n\nthe people around you into a plateau of intensity that would leave afterim-\n\nages of its dynamism that could be reinjected into still other lives, creating\n\na fabric of heightened states between which any number, the greatest num-\n\nber, of connecting routes would exist. Some might call that promiscuous.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari call it revolution.\n\nThe question is not: is it true? But: does it work? What new thoughts\n\ndoes it make it possible to think? What new emotions does it make it possi-\n\nble to feel? What new sensations and perceptions does it open in the body?\n\nThe answer for some readers, perhaps most, will be \"none.\" If that hap-\n\npens, it's not your tune. No problem.

It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage  \nfrom one experiential state of the body to another and implying an  \naugmentation or diminution in that body's capacity to act. _L'affection  \n_(Spinoza's _affectio) _is each such state considered as an encounter between  \nthe affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its  \nbroadest possible sense to include \"mental\" or ideal bodies).\n\nDRAW\n\n.\n\nIn _A Thousand Plateaus, _to draw is an act of creation. What is\n\ndrawn (the Body without Organs, the plane of consistency, a line of flight)  \ndoes not preexist the act of drawing. The French word _tracer _captures this  \nbetter: It has all the graphic connotations of \"to draw\" in English, but can  \nalso mean to blaze a trail or open a road. \"To trace\" _{decalquer), _on the  \nother hand, is to copy something from a model.\n\nFLIGHT\n\n/\n\nESCAPE\n\n.\n\nBoth words translate _fuite, _which has a different range\n\nof meanings than either of the English terms. _Fuite _covers not only the act  \nof fleeing or eluding but also flowing, leaking, and disappearing into the  \ndistance (the vanishing point in a painting is _a point de fuite). _It has no\nrela-  \ntion to flying.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)018.png)\n\nN\n\nOTES ON THE TRANSLATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS \u25a1 xvii\n\nMILIEU. In French, _milieu _means \"surroundings,\" \"medium\" (as in\n\nchemistry), and \"middle.\" In the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari,  \n\"milieu\" should be read as a technical term combining all three meanings.\n\nPLANE\n\n.\n\nThe word _plan _designates both a \"plane\" in the geometrical sense\n\nand a \"plan.\" The authors use it primarily in the first sense. Where both  \nmeanings seem to be present (as in discussions of _the, plan d'organisatori)  \n_\"plan(e)\" has been used in the translation.\n\nPOWER. Two words for \"power\" exist in French, _puissance _and _pouvoir. _\n\nIn Deleuze and Guattari, they are associated with very different concepts  \n(although the terminological distinction is not consistently observed).  \n_Puissance _refers to a range of potential. It has been defined by Deleuze as\na  \n\"capacity for existence,\" \"a capacity to affect or be affected,\" a capacity to  \nmultiply connections that may be realized by a given \"body\" to varying  \ndegrees in different situations. It may be thought of as a scale of intensity\nor  \nfullness of existence (or a degree on such a scale), analogous to the capacity  \nof a number to be raised to a higher \"power.\" It is used in the French trans-  \nlation of Nietzsche's term \"will to power.\" Like its English counterpart, it  \nhas an additional mathematical usage, designating the number of elements  \nin a finite or infinite set. Here, _puissance _pertains to the virtual (the\nplane  \nof consistency), _pouvoir _to the actual (the plane of organization). The  \nauthors _use pouvoir _in a sense very close to Foucault's, as an instituted\nand  \nreproducible relation of force, a selective concretization of potential. Both  \n_puissance _and _pouvoir _have been translated here as \"power,\" since the dis-  \ntinction between the concepts is usually clear from the context. The French  \nterms have been added in parentheses where confusion might arise, and in  \noccasional passages where _puissance _is rendered as \"potential.\"\n\nPROCESS\n\n/\n\nPROCEEDING\n\n.\n\nThe authors employ two words normally trans-\n\nlated as \"process.\" _Processus _in their usage is the more general of the two,  \ncovering both the stratified and destratified dimensions of an occurrence.  \n_Proces _pertains only to the stratification. In standard French, _proces\n_also  \nmeans \"trial\" (as in the title of the Kafka novel). Deleuze and Guattari  \nexploit this polysemy as a way of emphasizing the role of organizations of  \nsocial power and regimes of signs in operations constitutive of the subject,  \nor _proces de subjectivation. Proces _is usually (once again, there is\nslippage in  \ntheir usage) translated as \"proceeding,\" despite the occasional awkward-  \nness this produces in English, in an attempt to preserve both associations: a  \nprocess, or way of proceeding, and a legal proceeding, or trial. _Processus\n_is  \nalways \"process.\"\n\nSELF. Both _Moi _and _Soi _have usually been translated as \"Self,\" with the\n\nFrench in brackets. _Soi _is the self in its broadest sense, but as a neuter  \nthird-person pronoun implies an impersonality at the basis of the self.  \n_Moi _is a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)019.png)\n\nx\n\nviii D NOTES ON THE TRANSLATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nmore restricted concept: the \"me\" as subject of enunciation for the \"I\" _(je)\n_\n\nas subject of the statement. It is also the French term for the Freudian ego.\n\nSIGNIFIANCE/INTERPRETANCE. I have followed the increasingly com-\n\nmon practice of importing _signifiance _and _interpr'etance _into English\nwith-\n\nout modification. In Deleuze and Guattari these terms refer respectively to\n\nthe syntagmatic and paradigmatic processes of language as a \"signifying\n\nregime of signs.\" They are borrowed from Benveniste (\"signifying capac-\n\nity\" and \"interpretative capacity\" are the English translations used in\n\nBenveniste's work).\n\nSTATEMENT\n\n.\n\n_Enonce _(often \"utterance\") has been translated here as\n\n\"statement,\" in keeping with the choice of the English translators of\n\nFoucault, to whose conception Deleuze and Guattari's is closest. \"Enunci-\n\nation\" is used for _enonciation._\n\nTRAIT. The word _trait _has a range of meanings not covered by any single\n\nword in English. Literally, it refers to a graphic drawing, and to the act of\n\ndrawing a line. Abstractly, it is the purely graphic element. Figuratively, it\n\nis an identifying mark (a feature, or trait in the English sense), or any act\n\nconstituting a mark or sign. In linguistics, \"distinctive features\" _{traits  \ndistinctifs _or _traits pertinents) _are the elementary units of language that\n\ncombine to form a phoneme. _Trait _also refers to a projectile, especially an\n\narrow, and to the act of throwing a projectile. Here, \"trait\" has been\n\nretained in all but narrowly linguistic contexts.\n\nGENDER-BIASED\n\nUSAGE\n\nhas been largely eliminated through\n\nplural-ization or the use of male and female pronouns. However, where\n\nDeleuze and Guattari seem deliberately to be using \"man\" to designate a\n\nsocially constructed, patriarchal standard of human behavior applied to\n\nboth men and women, the masculine generic has been retained.\n\n*** * ***\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

All this, lines and measurable\n\nspeeds, constitutes an _assemblage. _A book is an assemblage of this kind,\n\nand as such is unattributable. It is a multiplicity\u2014but we don't know yet\n\nwhat the multiple entails when it is no longer attributed, that is, after it\nhas\n\nbeen elevated to the status of a substantive. One side of a machinic assem-\n\nblage faces the strata, which doubtless make it a kind of organism, or signi-\n\nfying totality, or determination attributable to a subject; it also has a side\n\nfacing a _body without organs, _which is continually dismantling the organ-\n\nism, causing asignifying particles or pure intensities to pass or circulate,\n\nand attributing to itself subjects that it leaves with nothing more than a\n\nname as the trace of an intensity. What is the body without organs of a\n\nbook? There are several, depending on the nature of the lines considered,\n\ntheir particular grade or density, and the possibility of their converging on\n\na \"plane of consistency\" assuring their selection. Here, as elsewhere, the\n\nunits of measure are what is essential: _quantify writing. _There is no\ndiffer-\n\nence between what a book talks about and how it is made. Therefore a book\n\nalso has no object. As an assemblage, a book has only itself, in connection\n\nwith other assemblages and in relation to other bodies without organs. We\n\nwill never ask what a book means, as signified or signifier; we will not look\n\nfor anything to understand in it. We will ask what it functions with, in con-\n\nnection with what other things it does or does not transmit intensities, in\n\nwhich other multiplicities its own are inserted and metamorphosed, and\n\nwith what bodies without organs it makes its own converge. A book exists\n\nonly through the outside and on the outside. A book itself is a little\n\nmachine; what is the relation (also measurable) of this literary machine to a\n\nwar machine, love machine, revolutionary machine, etc.\u2014and an _abstract  \nmachine _that sweeps them along? We have been criticized for overquoting\n\nliterary authors. But when one writes, the only question is which other\n\nmachine the literary machine can be plugged into, must be plugged into in\n\norder to work. Kleist and a mad war machine, Kafka and a most extraordi-\n\nnary bureaucratic machine . . . (What if one became animal or plant  \n_through _literature, which certainly does not mean literarily? Is it not\nfirst\n\nthrough the voice that one becomes animal?) Literature is an assemblage.\n\nIt has nothing to do with ideology. There is no ideology and never has been.\n\nAll we talk about are multiplicities, lines, strata and segmentarities, lines\n\nof flight and intensities, machinic assemblages and their various types,\n\nbodies without organs and their construction and selection, the plane of\n\nconsistency, and in each case the units of measure. _Stratometers,  \ndeleometers, BwO units of density, BwO units of convergence: _Not only do\n\nthese constitute a quantification of writing, but they define writing as\n\nalways the measure of something else.

It has to do with surveying, mapping, even realms that are yet to\n\ncome.\n\nA first type of book is the root-book. The tree is already the image of the\n\nworld, or the root the image of the world-tree. This is the classical book, as\n\nnoble, signifying, and subjective organic interiority (the strata of the\nbook).\n\nThe book imitates the world, as art imitates nature: by procedures specific\n\nto it that accomplish what nature cannot or can no longer do. The law of the\n\nbook is the law of reflection, the One that becomes two. How could the law\n\nof the book reside in nature, when it is what presides over the very division\n\nbetween world and book, nature and art? One becomes two: whenever we\n\nencounter this formula, even stated strategically by Mao or understood in\n\nthe most \"dialectical\" way possible, what we have before us is the most clas-\n\nsical and well reflected, oldest, and weariest kind of thought. Nature\n\ndoesn't work that way: in nature, roots are taproots with a more multiple,\n\nlateral, and circular system of ramification, rather than a dichotomous\n\none. Thought lags behind nature. Even the book as a natural reality is a tap-\n\nroot, with its pivotal spine and surrounding leaves. But the book as a spiri-\n\ntual reality, the Tree or Root as an image, endlessly develops the law of the\n\nOne that becomes two, then of the two that become four. . . Binary logic is\n\nthe spiritual reality of the root-tree. Even a discipline as \"advanced\" as\nlin-\n\nguistics retains the root-tree as its fundamental image, and thus remains\n\nwedded to classical reflection (for example, Chomsky and his grammatical\n\ntrees, which begin at a point S and proceed by dichotomy). This is as much\n\nas to say that this system of thought has never reached an understanding of\n\nmultiplicity: in order to arrive at two following a spiritual method it must\n\nassume a strong principal unity. On the side of the object, it is no doubt\npos-\n\nsible, following the natural method, to go directly from One to three, four,\n\nor five, but only if there is a strong principal unity available, that of the\npiv-\n\notal taproot supporting the secondary roots. That doesn't get us very far.\n\nThe binary logic of dichotomy has simply been replaced by biunivocal rela-\n\ntionships between successive circles. The pivotal taproot provides no bet-\n\nter understanding of multiplicity than the dichotomous root. One operates\n\nin the object, the other in the subject. Binary logic and biunivocal relation-\n\nships still dominate psychoanalysis (the tree of delusion in the Freudian\n\ninterpretation of Schreber's case), linguistics, structuralism, and even\n\ninformation science.\n\nThe radicle-system, or fascicular root, is the second figure of the book,\n\nto which our modernity pays willing allegiance. This time, the principal\n\nroot has aborted, or its tip has been destroyed; an immediate, indefinite\n\nmultiplicity of secondary roots grafts onto it and undergoes a flourishing\n\ndevelopment. This time, natural reality is what aborts the principal root,\n\nbut the root's unity subsists, as past or yet to come, as possible. We must\nask\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)027.png)\n\n6 D INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME\n\nif reflexive, spiritual reality does not compensate for this state of things\nby\n\ndemanding an even more comprehensive secret unity, or a more extensive\n\ntotality. Take William Burroughs's cut-up method: the folding of one text\n\nonto another, which constitutes multiple and even adventitious roots (like\n\na cutting), implies a supplementary dimension to that of the texts under\n\nconsideration. In this supplementary dimension of folding, unity contin-\n\nues its spiritual labor. That is why the most resolutely fragmented work can\n\nalso be presented as the Total Work or Magnum Opus. Most modern meth-\n\nods for making series proliferate or a multiplicity grow are perfectly valid\n\nin one direction, for example, a linear direction, whereas a unity of\n\ntotalization asserts itself even more firmly in another, circular or cyclic,\n\ndimension. Whenever a multiplicity is taken up in a structure, its growth is\n\noffset by a reduction in its laws of combination. The abortionists of unity\n\nare indeed angel makers, _doctores angelici, _because they affirm a properly\n\nangelic and superior unity. Joyce's words, accurately described as having\n\n\"multiple roots,\" shatter the linear unity of the word, even of language,\n\nonly to posit a cyclic unity of the sentence, text, or knowledge. Nietzsche's\n\naphorisms shatter the linear unity of knowledge, only to invoke the cyclic\n\nunity of the eternal return, present as the nonknown in thought. This is as\n\nmuch as to say that the fascicular system does not really break with dual-\n\nism, with the complementarity between a subject and an object, a natural\n\nreality and a spiritual reality: unity is consistently thwarted and obstructed\n\nin the object, while a new type of unity triumphs in the subject. The world\n\nhas lost its pivot; the subject can no longer even dichotomize, but accedes\n\nto a higher unity, of ambivalence or overdetermination, in an always sup-\n\nplementary dimension to that of its object. The world has become chaos,\n\nbut the book remains the image of the world: radicle-chaosmos rather than\n\nroot-cosmos. A strange mystification: a book all the more total for being\n\nfragmented. At any rate, what a vapid idea, the book as the image of the\n\nworld. In truth, it is not enough to say, \"Long live the multiple,\" difficult\nas\n\nit is to raise that cry. No typographical, lexical, or even syntactical\nclever-\n\nness is enough to make it heard. The multiple _must be made, _not by always\n\nadding a higher dimension, but rather in the simplest of ways, by dint of\n\nsobriety, with the number of dimensions one already has available\u2014\n\nalways _n _\\- 1 (the only way the one belongs to the multiple: always sub-\n\ntracted). Subtract the unique from the multiplicity to be constituted; write\n\nat _n _- 1 dimensions. A system of this kind could be called a rhizome. A rhi-\n\nzome as subterranean stem is absolutely different from roots and radicles.\n\nBulbs and tubers are rhizomes. Plants with roots or radicles may be\n\nrhizomorphic in other respects altogether: the question is whether plant\n\nlife in its specificity is not entirely rhizomatic. Even some animals are, in\n\ntheir pack form. Rats are rhizomes. Burrows are too, in all of their func-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)028.png)\n\n0\n\nINTRODUCTION: RHIZOME \u25a1 7\n\ntions of shelter, supply, movement, evasion, and breakout. The rhizome\n\nitself assumes very diverse forms, from ramified surface extension in all\n\ndirections to concretion into bulbs and tubers. When rats swarm over each\n\nother. The rhizome includes the best and the worst: potato and couchgrass,\n\nor the weed. Animal and plant, couchgrass is crabgrass. We get the distinct\n\nfeeling that we will convince no one unless we enumerate certain approxi-\n\nmate characteristics of the rhizome.\n\n1 and 2. Principles of connection and heterogeneity: any point of a rhi-\n\nzome can be connected to anything other, and must be. This is very differ-\n\nent from the tree or root, which plots a point, fixes an order. The linguistic\n\ntree on the Chomsky model still begins at a point S and proceeds by dichot-\n\nomy. On the contrary, not every trait in a rhizome is necessarily linked to a\n\nlinguistic feature: semiotic chains of every nature are connected to very\n\ndiverse modes of coding (biological, political, economic, etc.) that bring\n\ninto play not only different regimes of signs but also states of things of\ndif-\n\nfering status. _Collective assemblages of enunciation _function directly\n\nwithin _machinic assemblages; _it is not impossible to make a radical break\n\nbetween regimes of signs and their objects. Even when linguistics claims to\n\nconfine itself to what is explicit and to make no presuppositions about lan-\n\nguage, it is still in the sphere of a discourse implying particular modes of\n\nassemblage and types of social power. Chomsky's grammaticality, the cate-\n\ngorical S symbol that dominates every sentence, is more fundamentally a\n\nmarker of power than a syntactic marker: you will construct grammatically\n\ncorrect sentences, you will divide each statement into a noun phrase and a\n\nverb phrase (first dichotomy. . .). Our criticism of these linguistic models\n\nis not that they are too abstract but, on the contrary, that they are not\n\nabstract enough, that they do not reach the _abstract machine _that connects\n\na language to the semantic and pragmatic contents of statements, to collec-\n\ntive assemblages of enunciation, to a whole micropolitics of the social\n\nfield. A rhizome ceaselessly establishes connections between semiotic\n\nchains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sci-\n\nences, and social struggles. A semiotic chain is like a tuber agglomerating\n\nvery diverse acts, not only linguistic, but also perceptive, mimetic,\n\ngestural, and cognitive: there is no language in itself, nor are there any\nlin-\n\nguistic universals, only a throng of dialects, patois, slangs, and specialized\n\nlanguages. There is no ideal speaker-listener, any more than there is a\n\nhomogeneous linguistic community. Language is, in Weinreich's words,\n\n\"an essentially heterogeneous reality.\"\n\n1\n\nThere is no mother tongue, only a\n\npower takeover by a dominant language within a political multiplicity.\n\nLanguage stabilizes around a parish, a bishopric, a capital.

There is always something genealogical\n\nabout a tree. It is not a method for the people. A method of the rhizome\n\ntype, on the contrary, can analyze language only by decentering it onto\n\nother dimensions and other registers. A language is never closed upon\n\nitself, except as a function of impotence.\n\n3\\. Principle of multiplicity: it is only when the multiple is effectively\n\ntreated as a substantive, \"multiplicity,\" that it ceases to have any relation\nto\n\nthe One as subject or object, natural or spiritual reality, image and world.\n\nMultiplicities are rhizomatic, and expose arborescent\n\npseudomulti-plicities for what they are. There is no unity to serve as a pivot\n\nin the object, or to divide in the subject. There is not even the unity to\nabort\n\nin the object or \"return\" in the subject. A multiplicity has neither subject\n\nnor object, only determinations, magnitudes, and dimensions that cannot\n\nincrease in number without the multiplicity changing in nature (the laws\n\nof combination therefore increase in number as the multiplicity grows).\n\nPuppet strings, as a rhizome or multiplicity, are tied not to the supposed\n\nwill of an artist or puppeteer but to a multiplicity of nerve fibers, which\n\nform another puppet in other dimensions connected to the first: \"Call the\n\nstrings or rods that move the puppet the weave. It might be objected that  \n_its multiplicity _resides in the person of the actor, who projects it into\nthe\n\ntext. Granted; but the actor's nerve fibers in turn form a weave. And they\n\nfall through the gray matter, the grid, into the undifferentiated... . The\n\ninterplay approximates the pure activity of weavers attributed in myth to\n\nthe Fates or Norns.\"\n\n3\n\nAn assemblage is precisely this increase in the\n\ndimensions of a multiplicity that necessarily changes in nature as it\n\nexpands its connections. There are no points or positions in a rhizome,\n\nsuch as those found in a structure, tree, or root. There are only lines. When\n\nGlenn Gould speeds up the performance of a piece, he is not just displaying\n\nvirtuosity, he is transforming the musical points into lines, he is making the\n\nwhole piece proliferate. The number is no longer a universal concept\n\nmeasuring elements according to their emplacement in a given dimension,\n\nbut has itself become a multiplicity that varies according to the\n\ndimensions considered (the primacy of the domain over a complex of\n\nnumbers attached to that domain). We do not have units _(unites) _of\n\nmeasure, only multiplicities or varieties of measurement. The notion of\n\nunity _{unite) _appears only when there is a power takeover in the\n\nmultiplicity by the signifier or a corresponding subjectification\n\nproceeding: This is the case for a pivot-unity forming the basis for a set\n\nof biunivocal relationships between objective elements or points, or for the\n\nOne that divides following the law of a binary logic of differentiation in the\n\nsubject. Unity always operates in an empty dimension supplementary to\n\nthat of the system considered (overcoding).\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)030.png)\n\nThe point is that a rhizome or multiplicity never allows itself to be\n\novercoded, never has available a supplementary dimension over and\n\nabove its number of lines, that is, over and above the multiplicity of num-\n\nbers attached to those lines. All multiplicities are flat, in the sense that\nthey\n\nfill or occupy all of their dimensions: we will therefore speak _of a plane of  \nconsistency _of multiplicities, even though the dimensions of this \"plane\"\n\nincrease with the number of connections that are made on it. Multiplicities\n\nare defined by the outside: by the abstract line, the line of flight or\n\ndeterritorialization according to which they change in nature and connect\n\nwith other multiplicities. The plane of consistency (grid) is the outside of\n\nall multiplicities. The line of flight marks: the reality of a finite number\nof\n\ndimensions that the multiplicity effectively fills; the impossibility of a\nsup-\n\nplementary dimension, unless the multiplicity is transformed by the line of\n\nflight; the possibility and necessity of flattening all of the multiplicities\non\n\na single plane of consistency or exteriority, regardless of their number of\n\ndimensions. The ideal for a book would be to lay everything out on a plane\n\nof exteriority of this kind, on a single page, the same sheet: lived events,\nhis-\n\ntorical determinations, concepts, individuals, groups, social formations.\n\nKleist invented a writing of this type, a broken chain of affects and variable\n\nspeeds, with accelerations and transformations, always in a relation with\n\nthe outside. Open rings. His texts, therefore, are opposed in every way to\n\nthe classical or romantic book constituted by the interiority of a substance\n\nor subject. The war machine-book against the State apparatus-book. _Flat  \nmultiplicities of n dimensions _are asignifying and asubjective. They are\n\ndesignated by indefinite articles, or rather by partitives _{some _couchgrass,  \n_some _of a rhizome . ..).\n\n4\\. Principle of asignifying rupture: against the oversignifying breaks\n\nseparating structures or cutting across a single structure. A rhizome may be\n\nbroken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one of its\nold\n\nlines, or on new lines. You can never get rid of ants because they form an\n\nanimal rhizome that can rebound time and again after most of it has been\n\ndestroyed. Every rhizome contains lines of segmentarity according to\n\nwhich it is stratified, territorialized, organized, signified, attributed,\netc.,\n\nas well as lines of deterritorialization down which it constantly flees. There\n\nis a rupture in the rhizome whenever segmentary lines explode into a line\n\nof flight, but the line of flight is part of the rhizome. These lines always\ntie\n\nback to one another. That is why one can never posit a dualism or a dichot-\n\nomy, even in the rudimentary form of the good and the bad. You may make\n\na rupture, draw a line of flight, yet there is still a danger that you will\n\nreencounter organizations that restratify everything, formations that\n\nrestore power to a signifier, attributions that reconstitute a subject\u2014\n\nanything you like, from Oedipal resurgences to fascist concretions.

Yes,\n\ncouchgrass is also a rhizome. Good and bad are only the products of an\n\nactive and temporary selection, which must be renewed.\n\nHow could movements of deterritorialization and processes of\n\nreterri-torialization not be relative, always connected, caught up in one\n\nanother? The orchid deterritorializes by forming an image, a tracing of a\n\nwasp; but the wasp reterritorializes on that image. The wasp is\n\nnevertheless deterritorialized, becoming a piece in the orchid's\n\nreproductive apparatus. But it reterritorializes the orchid by transporting\n\nits pollen. Wasp and orchid, as heterogeneous elements, form a rhizome.\n\nIt could be said that the orchid imitates the wasp, reproducing its image in\n\na signifying fashion (mimesis, mimicry, lure, etc.). But this is true only on\n\nthe level of the strata\u2014a parallelism between two strata such that a plant\n\norganization on one imitates an animal organization on the other. At the\n\nsame time, something else entirely is going on: not imitation at all but a\n\ncapture of code, surplus value of code, an increase in valence, a veritable\n\nbecoming, a becoming-wasp of the orchid and a becoming-orchid of the\n\nwasp. Each of these becomings brings about the deterritorialization of\n\none term and the reterritorialization of the other; the two becomings\n\ninterlink and form relays in a circulation of intensities pushing the\n\ndeterritorialization ever further. There is neither imitation nor\n\nresemblance, only an exploding of two heterogeneous series on the line of\n\nflight composed by a common rhizome that can no longer be attributed to\n\nor subjugated by anything signifying. Rimy Chauvin expresses it well: \"the  \n_aparallel evolution _of two beings that have absolutely nothing to do with\n\neach other.\"\n\n4\n\nMore generally, evolutionary schemas may be forced to\n\nabandon the old model of the tree and descent. Under certain conditions,\n\na virus can connect to germ cells and transmit itself as the cellular gene\n\nof a complex species; moreover, it can take flight, move into the cells of an\n\nentirely different species, but not without bringing with it \"genetic\n\ninformation\" from the first host (for example, Benveniste and Todaro's\n\ncurrent research on a type C virus, with its double connection to baboon\n\nDNA and the DNA of certain kinds of domestic cats). Evolutionary\n\nschemas would no longer follow models of arborescent descent going from\n\nthe least to the most differentiated, but instead a rhizome operating\n\nimmediately in the heterogeneous and jumping from one already\n\ndifferentiated line to another.\n\n5\n\nOnce again, there is _aparallel evolution, _of\n\nthe baboon and the cat; it is obvious that they are not models or copies of\n\neach other (a becoming-baboon in the cat does not mean that the cat\n\n\"plays\" baboon). We form a rhizome with our viruses, or rather our viruses\n\ncause us to form a rhizome with other animals. As Francois Jacob says,\n\ntransfers of genetic material by viruses or through other procedures,\n\nfusions of cells originating in different species, have results analogous to\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)032.png)\n\nI\n\nNTRODUCTION: RHIZOME \u25a1 11\n\nthose of \"the abominable couplings dear to antiquity and the Middle\n\nAges.\"\n\n6\n\nTransversal communications between different lines scramble the\n\ngenealogical trees. Always look for the molecular, or even submolecular,\n\nparticle with which we are allied. We evolve and die more from our\n\npolymorphous and rhizomatic flus than from hereditary diseases, or\n\ndiseases that have their own line of descent. The rhizome is an\n\nanti-genealogy.\n\nThe same applies to the book and the world: contrary to a deeply rooted\n\nbelief, the book is not an image of the world. It forms a rhizome with the\n\nworld, there is an aparallel evolution of the book and the world; the book\n\nassures the deterritorialization of the world, but the world effects a\n\nreterri-torialization of the book, which in turn deterritorializes itself in\nthe\n\nworld (if it is capable, if it can). Mimicry is a very bad concept, since it\n\nrelies on binary logic to describe phenomena of an entirely different\n\nnature. The crocodile does not reproduce a tree trunk, any more than the\n\nchameleon reproduces the colors of its surroundings. The Pink Panther\n\nimitates nothing, it reproduces nothing, it paints the world its color, pink\non\n\npink; this is its becoming-world, carried out in such a way that it becomes\n\nimperceptible itself, asignifying, makes its rupture, its own line of flight,\n\nfollows its \"aparallel evolution\" through to the end. The wisdom of the\n\nplants: even when they have roots, there is always an outside where they\n\nform a rhizome with something else\u2014with the wind, an animal, human\n\nbeings (and there is also an aspect under which animals themselves form\n\nrhizomes, as do people, etc.). \"Drunkenness as a triumphant irruption of\n\nthe plant in us.\" Always follow the rhizome by rupture; lengthen, prolong,\n\nand relay the line of flight; make it vary, until you have produced the most\n\nabstract and tortuous of lines of _n _dimensions and broken directions.\n\nConjugate deterritorialized flows. Follow the plants: you start by delimiting\n\na first line consisting of circles of convergence around successive\n\nsingularities; then you see whether inside that line new circles of\n\nconvergence establish themselves, with new points located outside the\n\nlimits and in other directions. Write, form a rhizome, increase your\n\nterritory by deterritorialization, extend the line of flight to the point\nwhere\n\nit becomes an abstract machine covering the entire plane of consistency.\n\n\"Go first to your old plant and watch carefully the watercourse made by\n\nthe rain.

Principle of cartography and decalcomania: a rhizome is not\n\namenable to any structural or generative model. It is a stranger to any idea\n\nof genetic axis or deep structure. A genetic axis is like an objective pivotal\n\nunity upon which successive stages are organized; a deep structure is more\n\nlike a base sequence that can be broken down into immediate constituents,\n\nwhile the unity of the product passes into another, transformational and\n\nsubjective, dimension. This does not constitute a departure from the repre-\n\nsentative model of the tree, or root\u2014pivotal taproot or fascicles (for exam-\n\nple, Chomsky's \"tree\" is associated with a base sequence and represents the\n\nprocess of its own generation in terms of binary logic). A variation on the\n\noldest form of thought. It is our view that genetic axis and profound struc-\n\nture are above all infinitely reproducible principles of _tracing. _All of\ntree\n\nlogic is a logic of tracing and reproduction. In linguistics as in\npsychoanaly-\n\nsis, its object is an unconscious that is itself representative, crystallized\n\ninto codified complexes, laid out along a genetic axis and distributed\n\nwithin a syntagmatic structure. Its goal is to describe a de facto state, to\n\nmaintain balance in intersubjective relations, or to explore an unconscious\n\nthat is already there from the start, lurking in the dark recesses of memory\n\nand language. It consists of tracing, on the basis of an overcoding structure\n\nor supporting axis, something that comes ready-made. The tree articulates\n\nand hierarchizes tracings; tracings are like the leaves of a tree.\n\nThe rhizome is altogether different, a _map and not a tracing. _Make a\n\nmap, not a tracing. The orchid does not reproduce the tracing of the wasp;\n\nit forms a map with the wasp, in a rhizome. What distinguishes the map\n\nfrom the tracing is that it is entirely oriented toward an experimentation in\n\ncontact with the real. The map does not reproduce an unconscious closed\n\nin upon itself; it constructs the unconscious. It fosters connections between\n\nfields, the removal of blockages on bodies without organs, the maximum\n\nopening of bodies without organs onto a plane of consistency. It is itself a\n\npart of the rhizome. The map is open and connectable in all of its dimen-\n\nsions; it is detachable, reversible, susceptible to constant modification. It\n\ncan be torn, reversed, adapted to any kind of mounting, reworked by an\n\nindividual, group, or social formation. It can be drawn on a wall, conceived\n\nof as a work of art, constructed as a political action or as a meditation.\nPer-\n\nhaps one of the most important characteristics of the rhizome is that it\n\nalways has multiple entryways; in this sense, the burrow is an animal rhi-\n\nzome, and sometimes maintains a clear distinction between the line of\n\nflight as passageway and storage or living strata (cf. the muskrat). A map\n\nhas multiple entryways, as opposed to the tracing, which always comes\n\nback \"to the same.\" The map has to do with performance, whereas the trac-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)034.png)\n\nI\n\nNTRODUCTION: RHIZOME \u25a1 13\n\ning always involves an alleged \"competence.\" Unlike psychoanalysis, psy-\n\nchoanalytic competence (which confines every desire and statement to a\n\ngenetic axis or overcoding structure, and makes infinite, monotonous trac-\n\nings of the stages on that axis or the constituents of that structure),\n\nschizoanalysis rejects any idea of pretraced destiny, whatever name is\n\ngiven to it\u2014divine, anagogic, historical, economic, structural, hereditary,\n\nor syntagmatic. (It is obvious that Melanie Klein has no understanding of\n\nthe cartography of one of her child patients, Little Richard, and is content\n\nto make ready-made tracings\u2014Oedipus, the good daddy and the bad\n\ndaddy, the bad mommy and the good mommy\u2014while the child makes a\n\ndesperate attempt to carry out a performance that the psychoanalyst\n\ntotally misconstrues.)\n\n9\n\nDrives and part-objects are neither stages on a\n\ngenetic axis nor positions in a deep structure; they are political options for\n\nproblems, they are entryways and exits, impasses the child lives out politi-\n\ncally, in other words, with all the force of his or her desire.\n\nHave we not, however, reverted to a simple dualism by contrasting maps\n\nto tracings, as good and bad sides? Is it not of the essence of the map to be\n\ntraceable? Is it not of the essence of the rhizome to intersect roots and\n\nsometimes merge with them? Does not a map contain phenomena of\n\nredundancy that are already like tracings of its own? Does not a multipli-\n\ncity have strata upon which unifications and totalizations, massifications,\n\nmimetic mechanisms, signifying power takeovers, and subjective attribu-\n\ntions take root? Do not even lines of flight, due to their eventual diver-\n\ngence, reproduce the very formations their function it was to dismantle or\n\noutflank? But the opposite is also true. It is a question of method: _the\ntrac-  \ning should always be put back on the map. _This operation and the previous\n\none are not at all symmetrical. For it is inaccurate to say that a tracing\n\nreproduces the map. It is instead like a photograph or X ray that begins by\n\nselecting or isolating, by artificial means such as colorations or other\n\nrestrictive procedures, what it intends to reproduce. The imitator always\n\ncreates the model, and attracts it. The tracing has already translated the\n\nmap into an image; it has already transformed the rhizome into roots and\n\nradicles. It has organized, stabilized, neutralized the multiplicities accord-\n\ning to the axes of signifiance and subjectification belonging to it. It has\ngen-\n\nerated, structurahzed the rhizome, and when it thinks it is reproducing\n\nsomething else it is in fact only reproducing itself. That is why the tracing\nis\n\nso dangerous. It injects redundancies and propagates them. What the trac-\n\ning reproduces of the map or rhizome are only the impasses, blockages,\n\nincipient taproots, or points of structuration. Take a look at psychoanalysis\n\nand linguistics: all the former has ever made are tracings or photos of the\n\nunconscious, and the latter of language, with all the betrayals that implies\n\n(it's not surprising that psychoanalysis tied its fate to that of\nlinguistics).\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)035.png)\n\n1\n\n4 \u25a1 INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME\n\nLook at what happened to Little Hans already, an example of child psycho-\n\nanalysis at its purest: they kept on BREAKING HIS RHIZOME and BLOTCHING\n\nHIS MAP, setting it straight for him, blocking his every way out, until he\n\nbegan to desire his own shame and guilt, until they had rooted shame and\n\nguilt in him, PHOBIA (they barred him from the rhizome of the building,\n\nthen from the rhizome of the street, they rooted him in his parents' bed,\n\nthey radicled him to his own body, they fixated him on Professor Freud).\n\nFreud explicitly takes Little Hans's cartography into account, but always\n\nand only in order to project it back onto the family photo. And look what\n\nMelanie Klein did to Little Richard's geopolitical maps: she developed\n\nphotos from them, made tracings of them. Strike the pose or follow the\n\naxis, genetic stage or structural destiny\u2014one way or the other, your rhi-\n\nzome will be broken. You will be allowed to live and speak, but only after\n\nevery outlet has been obstructed. Once a rhizome has been obstructed,\n\narborified, it's all over, no desire stirs; for it is always by rhizome that\ndesire\n\nmoves and produces. Whenever desire climbs a tree, internal repercus-\n\nsions trip it up and it falls to its death; the rhizome, on the other hand,\nacts\n\non desire by external, productive outgrowths.\n\nThat is why it is so important to try the other, reverse but nonsym-\n\nmetrical, operation. Plug the tracings back into the map, connect the roots\n\nor trees back up with a rhizome. In the case of Little Hans, studying the\n\nunconscious would be to show how he tries to build a rhizome, with the\n\nfamily house but also with the line of flight of the building, the street,\netc.;\n\nhow these lines are blocked, how the child is made to take root in the family,\n\nbe photographed under the father, be traced onto the mother's bed; then\n\nhow Professor Freud's intervention assures a power takeover by the\n\nsignifier, a subjectification of affects; how the only escape route left to\nthe\n\nchild is a becoming-animal perceived as shameful and guilty (the\n\nbecoming-horse of Little Hans, a truly political option). But these impasses\n\nmust always be resituated on the map, thereby opening them up to possible\n\nlines of flight. The same applies to the group map: show at what point in the\n\nrhizome there form phenomena of massification, bureaucracy, leadership,\n\nfascization, etc., which lines nevertheless survive, if only underground,\n\ncontinuing to make rhizome in the shadows. Deligny's method: map the\n\ngestures and movements of an autistic child, combine several maps for the\n\nsame child, for several different children.\n\n10\n\nIf it is true that it is of the\n\nessence of the map or rhizome to have multiple entryways, then it is plausi-\n\nble that one could even enter them through tracings or the root-tree, assum-\n\ning the necessary precautions are taken (once again, one must avoid any\n\nManichaean dualism). For example, one will often be forced to take dead\n\nends, to work with signifying powers and subjective affections, to find a\n\nfoothold in formations that are Oedipal or paranoid or even worse,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)036.png)\n\nI\n\nNTRODUCTION: RHIZOME D 15\n\nrigidified territorialities that open the way for other transformational\n\noperations.

In other cases, on the contrary, one will bolster oneself\n\ndirectly on a line of flight enabling one to blow apart strata, cut roots, and\n\nmake new connections. Thus, there are very diverse map-tracing,\n\nrhizome-root assemblages, with variable coefficients of\n\ndeterritorialization. There exist tree or root structures in rhizomes;\n\nconversely, a tree branch or root division may begin to burgeon into a\n\nrhizome. The coordinates are determined not by theoretical analyses\n\nimplying universals but by a pragmatics composing multiplicities or\n\naggregates of intensities. A new rhizome may form in the heart of a tree,\n\nthe hollow of a root, the crook of a branch. Or else it is a microscopic\n\nelement of the root-tree, a radicle, that gets rhizome production going.\n\nAccounting and bureaucracy proceed by tracings: they can begin to\n\nburgeon nonetheless, throwing out rhizome stems, as in a Kafka novel.\n\nAn intensive trait starts working for itself, a hallucinatory perception,\n\nsynesthesia, perverse mutation, or play of images shakes loose, challenging\n\nthe hegemony of the signifier.

Short-term memory is in no way subject to a law of contiguity or\n\nimmediacy to its object; it can act at a distance, come or return a long time\n\nafter, but always under conditions of discontinuity, rupture, and multipli-\n\ncity. Furthermore, the difference between the two kinds of memory is not\n\nthat of two temporal modes of apprehending the same thing; they do not\n\ngrasp the same thing, memory, or idea. The splendor of the short-term\n\nIdea: one writes using short-term memory, and thus short-term ideas, even\n\nif one reads or rereads using long-term memory of long-term concepts.\n\nShort-term memory includes forgetting as a process; it merges not with the\n\ninstant but instead with the nervous, temporal, and collective rhizome.\n\nLong-term memory (family, race, society, or civilization) traces and trans-\n\nlates, but what it translates continues to act in it, from a distance,\noffbeat,\n\nin an \"untimely\" way, not instantaneously.\n\nThe tree and root inspire a sad image of thought that is forever imitating\n\nthe multiple on the basis of a centered or segmented higher unity. If we con-\n\nsider the set, branches-roots, the trunk plays the role of _opposed segment _\n\nfor one of the subsets running from bottom to top: this kind of segment is a\n\n\"link dipole,\" in contrast to the \"unit dipoles\" formed by spokes radiating\n\nfrom a single center.\n\n13\n\nEven if the links themselves proliferate, as in the\n\nradicle system, one can never get beyond the One-Two, and fake multiplici-\n\nties. Regenerations, reproductions, returns, hydras, and medusas do not\n\nget us any further. Arborescent systems are hierarchical systems with cen-\n\nters of signifiance and subjectification, central automata like organized\n\nmemories. In the corresponding models, an element only receives infor-\n\nmation from a higher unit, and only receives a subjective affection along\n\npreestablished paths. This is evident in current problems in information\n\nscience and computer science, which still cling to the oldest modes of\n\nthought in that they grant all power to a memory or central organ. Pierre\n\nRosenstiehl and Jean Petitot, in a fine article denouncing \"the imagery of\n\ncommand trees\" (centered systems or hierarchical structures), note that\n\n\"accepting the primacy of hierarchical structures amounts to giving\n\narborescent structures privileged status.... The arborescent form admits of\n\ntopological explanation.... In a hierarchical system, an individual has only\n\none active neighbor, his or her hierarchical superior.... The channels of\n\ntransmission are preestablished: the arborescent system preexists the\n\nindividual, who is integrated into it at an allotted place\" (signifiance and\n\nsubjectification). The authors point out that even when one thinks one has\n\nreached a multiplicity, it may be a false one\u2014of what we call the radicle\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)038.png)\n\nI\n\nNTRODUCTION: RHIZOME \u25a1 17\n\ntype\u2014because its ostensibly nonhierarchical presentation or statement in\n\nfact only admits of a totally hierarchical solution. An example is the\n\nfamous _friendship theorem: _\"If any two given individuals in a society have\n\nprecisely one mutual friend, then there exists an individual who is the\n\nfriend of all the others.\" (Rosenstiehl and Petitot ask who that mutual\n\nfriend is. Who is \"the universal friend in this society of couples: the\nmaster,\n\nthe confessor, the doctor? These ideas are curiously far removed from the\n\ninitial axioms.\" Who is this friend of humankind? Is it the .pMosopher as\n\nhe appears in classical thought, even if he is an aborted unity that makes\n\nitself felt only through its absence or subjectivity, saying all the while, I\n\nknow nothing, I am nothing?) Thus the authors speak of dictatorship theo-\n\nrems. Such is indeed the principle of roots-trees, or their outcome: the\n\nradicle solution, the structure of Power.\n\n14\n\nTo these centered systems, the authors contrast acentered systems,\n\nfinite networks of automata in which communication runs from any neigh-\n\nbor to any other, the stems or channels do not preexist, and all individuals\n\nare interchangeable, defined only by their _state _at a given moment\u2014such\n\nthat the local operations are coordinated and the final, global result syn-\n\nchronized without a central agency. Transduction of intensive states\n\nreplaces topology, and \"the graph regulating the circulation of information\n\nis in a way the opposite of the hierarchical graph.. . . There is no reason\nfor\n\nthe graph to be a tree\" (we have been calling this kind of graph a map). The\n\nproblem of the war machine, or the firing squad: is a general necessary for _n\n_\n\nindividuals to manage to fire in unison? The solution without a General is\n\nto be found in an acentered multiplicity possessing a finite number of\n\nstates with signals to indicate corresponding speeds, from a war rhizome or\n\nguerrilla logic point of view, without any tracing, without any copying of a\n\ncentral order. The authors even demonstrate that this kind of machinic\n\nmultiplicity, assemblage, or society rejects any centralizing or unifying\n\nautomaton as an \"asocial intrusion.\"\n\n15\n\nUnder these conditions, _n _is in fact\n\nalways _n _- 1\\. Rosenstiehl and Petitot emphasize that the opposition,\n\ncentered-acentered, is valid less as a designation for things than as a mode\n\nof calculation applied to things. Trees may correspond to the rhizome, or\n\nthey may burgeon into a rhizome. It is true that the same thing is generally\n\nsusceptible to both modes of calculation or both types of regulation, but\n\nnot without undergoing a change in state. Take psychoanalysis as an exam-\n\nple again: it subjects the unconscious to arborescent structures, hierarchi-\n\ncal graphs, recapitulatory memories, central organs, the phallus, the\n\nphallus-tree\u2014not only in its theory but also in its practice of calculation\n\nand treatment. Psychoanalysis cannot change its method in this regard: it\n\nbases its own dictatorial power upon a dictatorial conception of the uncon-\n\nscious.

In both psychoanalysis and its object, there is always a general,\n\nalways a leader (General Freud). Schizoanalysis, on the other hand, treats\n\nthe unconscious as an acentered system, in other words, as a machinic net-\n\nwork of finite automata (a rhizome), and thus arrives at an entirely differ-\n\nent state of the unconscious. These same remarks apply to linguistics;\n\nRosenstiehl and Petitot are right to bring up the possibility of an\n\n\"acentered organization of a society of words.\" For both statements and\n\ndesires, the issue is never to reduce the unconscious or to interpret it or to\n\nmake it signify according to a tree model. The issue is to _produce the uncon-  \nscious, _and with it new statements, different desires: the rhizome is pre-\n\ncisely this production of the unconscious.\n\nIt is odd how the tree has dominated Western reality and all of Western\n\nthought, from botany to biology and anatomy, but also gnosiology, theol-\n\nogy, ontology, all of philosophy . ..: the root-foundation, _Grund, racine,  \nfondement. _The West has a special relation to the forest, and deforestation;\n\nthe fields carved from the forest are populated with seed plants produced\n\nby cultivation based on species lineages of the arborescent type; animal\n\nraising, carried out on fallow fields, selects lineages forming an entire ani-\n\nmal arborescence. The East presents a different figure: a relation to the\n\nsteppe and the garden (or in some cases, the desert and the oasis), rather\n\nthan forest and field; cultivation of tubers by fragmentation of the individ-\n\nual; a casting aside or bracketing of animal raising, which is confined to\n\nclosed spaces or pushed out onto the steppes of the nomads. The West: agri-\n\nculture based on a chosen lineage containing a large number of variable\n\nindividuals. The East: horticulture based on a small number of individuals\n\nderived from a wide range of \"clones.\" Does not the East, Oceania in par-\n\nticular, offer something like a rhizomatic model opposed in every respect\n\nto the Western model of the tree? Andre Haudricourt even sees this as the\n\nbasis for the opposition between the moralities or philosophies of tran-\n\nscendence dear to the West and the immanent ones of the East: the God\n\nwho sows and reaps, as opposed to the God who replants and unearths\n\n(replanting of offshoots versus sowing of seeds).\n\n16\n\nTranscendence: a specif-\n\nically European disease. Neither is music the same, the music of the earth is\n\ndifferent, as is sexuality: seed plants, even those with two sexes in the same\n\nplant, subjugate sexuality to the reproductive model; the rhizome, on the\n\nother hand, is a liberation of sexuality not only from reproduction but also\n\nfrom genitality. Here in the West, the tree has implanted itself in our bod-\n\nies, rigidifying and stratifying even the sexes. We have lost the rhizome, or\n\nthe grass.

The old China, the new, an\n\nimaginary one, or yet another located on a shifting map?\n\nAmerica is a special case. Of course it is not immune from domination\n\nby trees or the search for roots. This is evident even in the literature, in\nthe\n\nquest for a national identity and even for a European ancestry or genealogy\n\n(Kerouac going off in search of his ancestors). Nevertheless, everything\n\nimportant that has happened or is happening takes the route of the Ameri-\n\ncan rhizome: the beatniks, the underground, bands and gangs, successive\n\nlateral offshoots in immediate connection with an outside. American\n\nbooks are different from European books, even when the American sets off\n\nin pursuit of trees. The conception of the book is different. _Leaves of\nGrass. _\n\nAnd directions in America are different: the search for arborescence and\n\nthe return to the Old World occur in the East. But there is the rhizomatic\n\nWest, with its Indians without ancestry, its ever-receding limit, its shifting\n\nand displaced frontiers. There is a whole American \"map\" in the West,\n\nwhere even the trees form rhizomes. America reversed the directions: it put\n\nits Orient in the West, as if it were precisely in America that the earth came\n\nfull circle; its West is the edge of the East.\n\n18\n\n(India is not the intermediary\n\nbetween the Occident and the Orient, as Haudricourt believed: America is\n\nthe pivot point and mechanism of reversal.)

The\n\nkings of France chose the lily because it is a plant with deep roots that\nclings\n\nto slopes. Is bureaucracy the same in the Orient? Of course it is all too easy\n\nto depict an Orient of rhizomes and immanence; yet it is true that in the\n\nOrient the State does not act following a schema of arborescence corre-\n\nsponding to preestablished, arborified, and rooted classes; its bureaucracy\n\nis one of channels, for example, the much-discussed case of hydraulic\n\npower with \"weak property,\" in which the State engenders channeled and\n\nchannelizing classes (cf. the aspects of Wittfogel's work that have not been\n\nrefuted).\n\n19\n\nThe despot acts as a river, not as a fountainhead, which is still a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)041.png)\n\n2\n\n0 \u25a1 INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME\n\npoint, a tree-point or root; he flows with the current rather than sitting\n\nunder a tree; Buddha's tree itself becomes a rhizome; Mao's river and\n\nLouis's tree. Has not America acted as an intermediary here as well? For it\n\nproceeds both by internal exterminations and liquidations (not only the\n\nIndians but also the farmers, etc.), and by successive waves of immigration\n\nfrom the outside. The flow of capital produces an immense channel, a\n\nquantification of power with immediate \"quanta,\" where each person\n\nprofits from the passage of the money flow in his or her own way (hence the\n\nreality-myth of the poor man who strikes it rich and then falls into poverty\n\nagain): in America everything comes together, tree and channel, root and\n\nrhizome. There is no universal capitalism, there is no capitalism in itself;\n\ncapitalism is at the crossroads of all kinds of formations, it is\nneocapitalism\n\nby nature. It invents its eastern face and western face, and reshapes them\n\nboth\u2014all for the worst.\n\nAt the same time, we are on the wrong track with all these geographical\n\ndistributions. An impasse. So much the better. If it is a question of showing\n\nthat rhizomes also have their own, even more rigid, despotism and hierar-\n\nchy, then fine and good: for there is no dualism, no ontological dualism\n\nbetween here and there, no axiological dualism between good and bad, no\n\nblend or American synthesis. There are knots of arborescence in rhizomes,\n\nand rhizomatic offshoots in roots. Moreover, there are despotic formations\n\nof immanence and channelization specific to rhizomes, just as there are\n\nanarchic deformations in the transcendent system of trees, aerial roots,\n\nand subterranean stems. The important point is that the root-tree and\n\ncanal-rhizome are not two opposed models: the first operates as a tran-\n\nscendent model and tracing, even if it engenders its own escapes; the sec-\n\nond operates as an immanent process that overturns the model and\n\noutlines a map, even if it constitutes its own hierarchies, even if it gives\nrise\n\nto a despotic channel. It is not a question of this or that place on earth, or\nof\n\na given moment in history, still less of this or that category of thought. It\nis a\n\nquestion of a model that is perpetually in construction or collapsing, and of\n\na process that is perpetually prolonging itself, breaking off and starting up\n\nagain. No, this is not a new or different dualism. The problem of writing: in\n\norder to designate something exactly, anexact expressions are utterly\n\nunavoidable. Not at all because it is a necessary step, or because one can\n\nonly advance by approximations: anexactitude is in no way an approxima-\n\ntion; on the contrary, it is the exact passage of that which is under way. We\n\ninvoke one dualism only in order to challenge another. We employ a dual-\n\nism of models only in order to arrive at a process that challenges all models.\n\nEach time, mental correctives are necessary to undo the dualisms we had\n\nno wish to construct but through which we pass.

The rhizome\n\nis reducible neither to the One nor the multiple. It is not the One that\n\nbecomes Two or even directly three, four, five, etc. It is not a multiple\n\nderived from the One, or to which One is added _(n + _1). It is composed not\n\nof units but of dimensions, or rather directions in motion. It has neither\n\nbeginning nor end, but always a middle _(milieu) _from which it grows and\n\nwhich it overspills. It constitutes linear multiplicities with _n _dimensions\n\nhaving neither subject nor object, which can be laid out on a plane of con-\n\nsistency, and from which the One is always subtracted _(n _\\- 1). When a mul-\n\ntiplicity of this kind changes dimension, it necessarily changes in nature as\n\nwell, undergoes a metamorphosis. Unlike a structure, which is defined by a\n\nset of points and positions, with binary relations between the points and\n\nbiunivocal relationships between the positions, the rhizome is made only\n\nof lines: lines of segmentarity and stratification as its dimensions, and the\n\nline of flight or deterritorialization as the maximum dimension after\n\nwhich the multiplicity undergoes metamorphosis, changes in nature.\n\nThese lines, or lineaments, should not be confused with lineages of the\n\narborescent type, which are merely localizable linkages between points and\n\npositions. Unlike the tree, the rhizome is not the object of reproduction:\n\nneither external reproduction as image-tree nor internal reproduction as\n\ntree-structure. The rhizome is an antigenealogy. It is a short-term memory,\n\nor antimemory. The rhizome operates by variation, expansion, conquest,\n\ncapture, offshoots. Unlike the graphic arts, drawing, or photography,\n\nunlike tracings, the rhizome pertains to a map that must be produced, con-\n\nstructed, a map that is always detachable, connectable, reversible,\n\nmodifiable, and has multiple entryways and exits and its own lines of\n\nflight. It is tracings that must be put on the map, not the opposite. In con-\n\ntrast to centered (even polycentric) systems with hierarchical modes of\n\ncommunication and preestablished paths, the rhizome is an acentered,\n\nnonhierarchical, nonsignifying system without a General and without an\n\norganizing memory or central automaton, defined solely by a circulation\n\nof states. What is at question in the rhizome is a relation to sexuality\u2014but\n\nalso to the animal, the vegetal, the world, politics, the book, things natural\n\nand artificial\u2014that is totally different from the arborescent relation: all\n\nmanner of \"becomings.\"\n\nA plateau is always in the middle, not at the beginning or the end. A rhi-\n\nzome is made of plateaus. Gregory Bateson uses the word \"plateau\" to\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)043.png)\n\n2\n\n2 \u25a1 INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME\n\ndesignate something very special: a continuous, self-vibrating region of\n\nintensities whose development avoids any orientation toward a culmina-\n\ntion point or external end. Bateson cites Balinese culture as an example:\n\nmother-child sexual games, and even quarrels among men, undergo this\n\nbizarre intensive stabilization. \"Some sort of continuing plateau of inten-\n\nsity is substituted for [sexual] climax,\" war, or a culmination point. It is a\n\nregrettable characteristic of the Western mind to relate expressions and\n\nactions to exterior or transcendent ends, instead of evaluating them on a\n\nplane of consistency on the basis of their intrinsic value.\n\n20\n\nFor example, a\n\nbook composed of chapters has culmination and termination points. What\n\ntakes place in a book composed instead of plateaus that communicate with\n\none another across microfissures, as in a brain? We call a \"plateau\" any\n\nmultiplicity connected to other multiplicities by superficial underground\n\nstems in such a way as to form or extend a rhizome. We are writing this\n\nbook as a rhizome. It is composed of plateaus. We have given it a circular\n\nform, but only for laughs. Each morning we would wake up, and each of us\n\nwould ask himself what plateau he was going to tackle, writing five lines\n\nhere, ten there. We had hallucinatory experiences, we watched lines leave\n\none plateau and proceed to another like columns of tiny ants. We made cir-\n\ncles of convergence. Each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be\n\nrelated to any other plateau. To attain the multiple, one must have a\n\nmethod that effectively constructs it; no typographical cleverness, no lexi-\n\ncal agility, no blending or creation of words, no syntactical boldness, can\n\nsubstitute for it. In fact, these are more often than not merely mimetic pro-\n\ncedures used to disseminate or disperse a unity that is retained in a differ-\n\nent dimension for an image-book. Technonarcissism. Typographical,\n\nlexical, or syntactic creations are necessary only when they no longer\n\nbelong to the form of expression of a hidden unity, becoming themselves\n\ndimensions of the multiplicity under consideration; we only know of rare\n\nsuccesses in this.\n\n21\n\nWe ourselves were unable to do it. We just used words\n\nthat in turn function for us as plateaus. RHIZOMATICS = SCHIZOANALYSIS =\n\nSTRATOA\n\nNALYSIS\n\n=\n\nPRAGMATICS\n\n=\n\nMICROPOLITICS\n\n.\n\nThese words are con-\n\ncepts, but concepts are lines, which is to say, number systems attached to a\n\nparticular dimension of the multiplicities (strata, molecular chains, lines\n\nof flight or rupture, circles of convergence, etc.). Nowhere do we claim for\n\nour concepts the title of a science. We are no more familiar with\n\nscientif-icity than we are with ideology; all we know are assemblages. And\n\nthe only assemblages are machinic assemblages of desire and collective\n\nassemblages of enunciation. No signifiance, no subjectification: writing\n\nto the \u00abth power (all individuated enunciation remains trapped within the\n\ndominant significations, all signifying desire is associated with dominated\n\nsubjects). An assemblage, in its multiplicity, necessarily acts on semiotic\n\nflows,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)044.png)\n\nI\n\nNTRODUCTION: RHIZOME \u25a1 23\n\nmaterial flows, and social flows simultaneously (independently of any\n\nrecapitulation that may be made of it in a scientific or theoretical corpus).\n\nThere is no longer a tripartite division between a field of reality (the\nworld)\n\nand a field of representation (the book) and a field of subjectivity (the\n\nauthor). Rather, an assemblage establishes connections between certain\n\nmultiplicities drawn from each of these orders, so that a book has no sequel\n\nnor the world as its object nor one or several authors as its subject. In\nshort,\n\nwe think that one cannot write sufficiently in the name of an outside. The\n\noutside has no image, no signification, no subjectivity. The book as assem-\n\nblage with the outside, against the book as image of the world. A\n\nrhizome-book, not a dichotomous, pivotal, or fascicular book. Never send\n\ndown roots, or plant them, however difficult it may be to avoid reverting\n\nto the old procedures. \"Those things which occur to me, occur to me not\n\nfrom the root up but rather only from somewhere about their middle. Let\n\nsomeone then attempt to seize them, let someone attempt to seize a blade\n\nof grass and hold fast to it when it begins to grow only from the middle.\"\n\n22\n\nWhy is this so difficult? The question is directly one of perceptual\n\nsemiotics. It's not easy to see things in the middle, rather than looking down\n\non them from above or up at them from below, or from left to right or right\n\nto left: try it, you'll see that everything changes. It's not easy to see the\ngrass\n\nin things and in words (similarly, Nietzsche said that an aphorism had to\n\nbe \"ruminated\"; never is a plateau separable from the cows that populate\n\nit, which are also the clouds in the sky).\n\nHistory is always written from the sedentary point of view and in the\n\nname of a unitary State apparatus, at least a possible one, even when the\n\ntopic is nomads. What is lacking is a Nomadology, the opposite of a history.\n\nThere are rare successes in this also, for example, on the subject of the\n\nChildren's Crusades: Marcel Schwob's book multiplies narratives like so\n\nmany plateaus with variable numbers of dimensions. Then there is\n\nAndrzejewski's book, _Les portes du paradis _(The gates of paradise), com-\n\nposed of a single uninterrupted sentence; a flow of children; a flow of walk-\n\ning with pauses, straggling, and forward rushes; the semiotic flow of the\n\nconfessions of all the children who go up to the old monk at the head of the\n\nprocession to make their declarations; a flow of desire and sexuality, each\n\nchild having left out of love and more or less directly led by the dark\nposthu-\n\nmous pederastic desire of the count of Vendome; all this with circles of con-\n\nvergence. What is important is not whether the flows are \"One or\n\nmultiple\"\u2014we're past that point: there is a collective assemblage of enun-\n\nciation, a machinic assemblage of desire, one inside the other and both\n\nplugged into an immense outside that is a multiplicity in any case. A more\n\nrecent example is Armand Farrachi's book on the Fourth Crusade, _La dis-  \nlocation, _in which the sentences space themselves out and disperse, or else\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)045.png)\n\n2\n\n4 \u25a1 INTRODUCTION: RHIZOME\n\njostle together and coexist, and in which the letters, the typography begin\n\nto dance as the crusade grows more delirious.\n\n23\n\nThese are models of\n\nnomadic and rhizomatic writing. Writing weds a war machine and lines of\n\nflight, abandoning the strata, segmentarities, sedentarity, the State\n\napparatus. But why is a model still necessary? Aren't these books still\n\n\"images\" of the Crusades? Don't they still retain a unity, in Schwob's case a\n\npivotal unity, in Farrachi's an aborted unity, and in the most beautiful\n\nexample, _Les portes du paradis, _the unity of the funereal count? Is there a\n\nneed for a more profound nomadism than that of the Crusades, a\n\nnomadism of true nomads, or of those who no longer even move or imitate\n\nanything? The nomadism of those who only assemble _(agencent). _How can\n\nthe book find an adequate outside with which to assemble in heterogeneity,\n\nrather than a world to reproduce? The cultural book is necessarily a tracing:\n\nalready a tracing of itself, a tracing of the previous book by the same\nauthor,\n\na tracing of other books however different they may be, an endless tracing\n\nof established concepts and words, a tracing of the world present, past, and\n\nfuture. Even the anticultural book may still be burdened by too heavy a cul-\n\ntural load: but it will use it actively, for forgetting instead of\nremembering,\n\nfor underdevelopment instead of progress toward development, in\n\nnomadism rather than sedentarity, to make a map instead of a tracing.\n\nRHIZOMATICS = POP ANALYSIS, even if the people have other things to do\n\nbesides read it, even if the blocks of academic culture or\n\npseudoscien-tificity in it are still too painful or ponderous. For science\n\nwould go completely mad if left to its own devices. Look at mathematics:\n\nit's not a science, it's a monster slang, it's nomadic. Even in the realm of\n\ntheory, especially in the realm of theory, any precarious and pragmatic\n\nframework is better than tracing concepts, with their breaks and progress\n\nchanging nothing. Imperceptible rupture, not signifying break. The\n\nnomads invented a war machine in opposition to the State apparatus.\n\nHistory has never comprehended nomadism, the book has never\n\ncomprehended the outside. The State as the model for the book and for\n\nthought has a long history: logos, the philosopher-king, the transcendence\n\nof the Idea, the interiority of the concept, the republic of minds, the court\n\nof reason, the functionaries of thought, man as legislator and subject.

He knew  \nthat Freud had a genius for brushing up against the truth and passing it by,  \nthen filling the void with associations. He knew that Freud knew nothing  \nabout wolves, or anuses for that matter. The only thing Freud understood  \nwas what a dog is, and a dog's tail. It wasn't enough. It wouldn't be enough.  \nThe Wolf-Man knew that Freud would soon declare him cured, but that it  \nwas not at all the case and his treatment would continue for all eternity  \nunder Brunswick, Lacan, Leclaire. Finally, he knew that he was in the pro-  \ncess of acquiring a veritable proper name, the Wolf-Man, a name more  \nproperly his than his own, since it attained the highest degree of singularity\n\n26\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)048.png)\n\n1\n\n914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? \u25a1 27\n\nin the instantaneous apprehension of a generic multiplicity: wolves. He\n\nknew that this new and true proper name would be disfigured and mis-\n\nspelled, retranscribed as a patronymic.\n\nFreud, for his part, would go on to write some extraordinary pages.\n\nEntirely practical pages: his article of 1915 on \"The Unconscious,\" which\n\ndeals with the difference between neurosis and psychosis. Freud says that\n\nhysterics or obsessives are people capable of making a global comparison\n\nbetween a sock and a vagina, a scar and castration, etc. Doubtless, it is at\n\none and the same time that they apprehend the object globally and perceive\n\nit as lost. Yet it would never occur to a neurotic to grasp the skin\nerotically\n\nas a multiplicity of pores, little spots, little scars or black holes, or to\ngrasp\n\nthe sock erotically as a multiplicity of stitches. The psychotic can: \"we\n\nshould expect the multiplicity of these little cavities to prevent him from\n\nusing them as substitutes for the female genital.\"\n\n1\n\nComparing a sock to a\n\nvagina is OK, it's done all the time, but you'd have to be insane to compare\n\na pure aggregate of stitches to a field of vaginas: that's what Freud says.\n\nThis represents an important clinical discovery: a whole difference in style\n\nbetween neurosis and psychosis. For example, Salvador Dali, in attempt-\n\ning to reproduce his delusions, may go on at length about THE rhinoceros\n\nhorn; he has not for all of that left neurotic discourse behind. But when he\n\nstarts comparing goosebumps to a field of tiny rhinoceros horns, we get the\n\nfeeling that the atmosphere has changed and that we are now in the pres-\n\nence of madness. Is it still a question of a comparison at all? It is, rather,\na\n\npure multiplicity that changes elements, or _becomes. _On the micrological\n\nlevel, the little bumps \"become\" horns, and the horns, little penises.\n\nNo sooner does Freud discover the greatest art of the unconscious, this\n\nart of molecular multiplicities, than we find him tirelessly at work bringing\n\nback molar unities, reverting to his familiar themes of _the _father, _the\n_penis,  \n_the _vagina, Castration with a capital _C... _(On the verge of discovering a\n\nrhizome, Freud always returns to mere roots.) The reductive procedure of\n\nthe 1915 article is quite interesting: he says that the comparisons and iden-\n\ntifications of the neurotic are guided by representations of things, whereas\n\nall the psychotic has left are representations of words (for example, the\n\nword \"hole\"). \"What has dictated the substitution is not the resemblance\n\nbetween the things denoted but the sameness of the words used to express\n\nthem\" (p. 201). Thus, when there is no unity in the thing, there is at least\n\nunity and identity in the word. It will be noted that names are taken in their  \n_extensive _usage, in other words, function as common nouns ensuring the\n\nunification of an aggregate they subsume. The proper name can be nothing\n\nmore than an extreme case of the common noun, containing its already\n\ndomesticated multiplicity within itself and linking it to a being or object\n\nposited as unique. This jeopardizes, on the side of words and things both,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)049.png)\n\n2\n\n8 \u25a1 1914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES?\n\nthe relation of the proper name as an _intensity _to the multiplicity it\ninstan-  \ntaneously apprehends. For Freud, when the thing splinters and loses its  \nidentity, the word is still there to restore that identity or invent a new\none.  \nFreud counted on the word to reestablish a unity no longer found in things.  \nAre we not witnessing the first stirrings of a subsequent adventure, that of  \n_the _Signifier, the devious despotic agency that substitutes itself for  \nasignifying proper names and replaces multiplicities with the dismal unity  \nof an object declared lost?\n\nWe're not far from wolves. For the Wolf-Man, in his second so-called\n\npsychotic episode, kept constant watch over the variations or changing  \npath of the little holes or scars on the skin of his nose. During the first\nepi-  \nsode, which Freud declares neurotic, he recounted a dream he had about  \nsix or seven wolves in a tree, and drew five. Who is ignorant of the fact that  \nwolves travel in packs? Only Freud. Every child knows it. Not Freud. With  \nfalse scruples he asks, How are we to explain the fact that there are five,\nsix,  \nor seven wolves in this dream? He has decided that this is neurosis, so he  \nuses the other reductive procedure: free association on the level of the rep-  \nresentation of things, rather than verbal subsumption on the level of the  \nrepresentation of words. The result is the same, since it is always a question  \nof bringing back the unity or identity of the person or allegedly lost object.  \nThe wolves will have to be purged of their multiplicity. This operation is  \naccomplished by associating the dream with the tale, \"The Wolf and the  \nSeven Kid-Goats\" (only six of which get eaten). We witness Freud's reduc-  \ntive glee; we literally see multiplicity leave the wolves to take the shape of  \ngoats that have absolutely nothing to do with the story. Seven wolves that  \nare only kid-goats. Six wolves: the seventh goat (the Wolf-Man himself) is  \nhiding in the clock. Five wolves: he may have seen his parents make love at  \nfive o'clock, and the roman numeral V is associated with the erotic spread-  \ning of a woman's legs. Three wolves: the parents may have made love three  \ntimes. Two wolves: the first coupling the child may have seen was the two  \nparents _more ferarum, _or perhaps even two dogs. One wolf: the wolf is the  \nfather, as we all knew from the start. Zero wolves: he lost his tail, he is\nnot  \njust a castrater but also castrated. Who is Freud trying to fool? The wolves  \nnever had a chance to get away and save their pack: it was already decided  \nfrom the very beginning that animals could serve only to represent coitus  \nbetween parents, or, conversely, be represented by coitus between parents.  \nFreud obviously knows nothing about the fascination exerted by wolves  \nand the meaning of their silent call, the call to become-wolf. Wolves watch,  \nintently watch, the dreaming child; it is so much more reassuring to tell  \noneself that the dream produced a reversal and that it is really the child who  \nsees dogs or parents in the act of making love.

I say to her, Would you like to\n\nbe a wolf? She answers haughtily, How stupid, you can't be one wolf, you're\n\nalways eight or nine, six or seven. Not six or seven wolves all by yourself\nall\n\nat once, but one wolf among others, with five or six others. In\n\nbecoming-wolf, the important thing is the position of the mass, and above\n\nall the position of the subject itself in relation to the pack or\n\nwolf-multiplicity: how the subject joins or does not join the pack, how far\n\naway it stays, how it does or does not hold to the multiplicity. To soften\n\nthe harshness of her response, Franny recounts a dream: \"There is a\n\ndesert. Again, it wouldn't make any sense to say that I am _in _the desert.\nIt's\n\na panoramic vision of the desert, and it's not a tragic or uninhabited desert.\n\nIt's only a desert because of its ocher color and its blazing, shadowless\n\nsun. There is a teeming crowd in it, a swarm of bees, a rumble of soccer\n\nplayers, oragroup of Tuareg. _lam on the edge of the crowd, at the periphery;  \nbut I belong to it, I am attached to it by one of my extremities, a hand or  \nfoot. _I know that the periphery is the only place I can be, that I would die\nif\n\nI let myself be drawn into the center of the fray, but just as certainly if I\nlet\n\ngo of the crowd. This is not an easy position to stay in, it is even very\n\ndifficult to hold, for these beings are in constant motion and their\n\nmovements are unpredictable and follow no rhythm. They swirl, go\n\nnorth, then suddenly east; none of the individuals in the crowd remains\n\nin the same place in relation to the others. So I too am in perpetual\n\nmotion; all this demands a high level of tension, but it gives me a feeling of\n\nviolent, almost vertiginous, happiness.\" A very good schizo dream. To be\n\nfully a part of the crowd and at the same time completely outside it, removed\n\nfrom it: to be on the edge, to take a walk like Virginia Woolf (never again\n\nwill I say, _\"I am this, I am thai\")._\n\n_1_\n\nProblems of peopling in the unconscious: all that passes through the\n\npores of the schizo, the veins of the drug addict, swarming, teeming, fer-\n\nment, intensities, races and tribes.

And how about the \"Lilliputian hallucinations\" on\n\nether?

Schizos, on the other hand,\n\nhave sharp eyes and ears. They don't mistake the buzz and shove of the\n\ncrowd for daddy's voice. Once Jung had a dream about bones and skulls. A\n\nbone or a skull is never alone. Bones are a multiplicity. But Freud wants the\n\ndream to signify the death of _someone. _\"Jung was surprised and pointed\n\nout that there were several skulls, not just one. Yet Freud still. . .\"\n\n3\n\nA multiplicity of pores, or blackheads, of little scars or stitches. Breasts,\n\nbabies, and rods. A multiplicity of bees, soccer players, or Tuareg. A multi-\n\nplicity of wolves or jackals ... All of these things are irreducible but bring\n\nus to a certain status of the formations of the unconscious. Let us try to\n\ndefine the factors involved: first, something plays the role of the full\n\nbody\u2014the body without organs. In the preceding dream it was the desert.\n\nIn the Wolf-Man's dream it is the denuded tree upon which the wolves are\n\nperched. It is also the skin as envelope or ring, and the sock as reversible\n\nsurface. It can be a house or part of a house, any number of things, any-\n\nthing. Whenever someone makes love, really makes love, that person con-\n\nstitutes a body without organs, alone and with the other person or people.\n\nA body without organs is not an empty body stripped of organs, but a body\n\nupon which that which serves as organs (wolves, wolf eyes, wolf jaws?) is\n\ndistributed according to crowd phenomena, in Brownian motion, in the\n\nform of molecular multiplicities. The desert is populous. Thus the body\n\nwithout organs is opposed less to organs as such than to the organization of\n\nthe organs insofar as it composes an organism. The body without organs is\n\nnot a dead body but a living body all the more alive and teeming once it has\n\nblown apart the organism and its organization. Lice hopping on the beach.\n\nSkin colonies. The full body without organs is a body populated by multi-\n\nplicities. The problem of the unconscious has most certainly nothing to do\n\nwith generation but rather peopling, population. It is an affair of world-\n\nwide population on the full body of the earth, not organic familial genera-\n\ntion. \"I love to invent peoples, tribes, racial origins ... I return from my\n\ntribes. As of today, I am the adoptive son of fifteen tribes, no more, no\nless.\n\nAnd they in turn are my adopted tribes, for I love each of them more than if\n\nI had been born into it.\" People say, After all, schizophrenics have a mother\n\nand a father, don't they? Sorry, no, none as such. They only have a desert\n\nwith tribes inhabiting it, a full body clinging with multiplicities.\n\nThis brings us to the second factor, the nature of these multiplicities and\n\ntheir elements. RHIZOME. One of the essential characteristics of the dream\n\nof multiplicity is that each element ceaselessly varies and alters its\ndistance\n\nin relation to the others. On the Wolf-Man's nose, the elements, deter-\n\nmined as pores in the skin, little scars in the pores, little ruts in the scar\ntis-\n\nsue, ceaselessly dance, grow, and diminish. These variable distances are\n\nnot extensive quantities divisible by each other; rather, each is indivisible,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)052.png)\n\n1\n\n914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? \u25a1 31\n\nor \"relatively indivisible,\" in other words, they are not divisible below or\n\nabove a certain threshold, they cannot increase or diminish _without their  \nelements changing in nature. _A swarm of bees: here they come as a rumble\n\nof soccer players in striped jerseys, or a band of Tuareg. Or: the wolf clan\n\ndoubles up with a swarm of bees against the gang of Deulhs, under the\n\ndirection of Mowgli, who runs on the edge (yes, Kipling understood the call\n\nof the wolves, their libidinal meaning, better than Freud; and in the\n\nWolf-Man's case the story about wolves is followed by one about wasps\n\nand butterflies, we go from wolves to wasps). What is the significance of\n\nthese indivisible distances that are ceaselessly transformed, and cannot be\n\ndivided or transformed without their elements changing in nature each\n\ntime? Is it not the intensive character of this kind of multiplicity's\nelements\n\nand the relations between them? Exactly like a speed or a temperature,\n\nwhich is not composed of other speeds and temperatures but rather is\n\nenveloped in or envelops others, each of which marks a change in nature.\n\nThe metrical principle of these multiplicities is not to be found in a homo-\n\ngeneous milieu but resides elsewhere, in forces at work within them, in\n\nphysical phenomena inhabiting them, precisely in the libido, which consti-\n\ntutes them from within, and in constituting them necessarily divides into\n\ndistinct qualitative and variable flows. Freud himself recognizes the multi-\n\nplicity of libidinal \"currents\" that coexist in the Wolf-Man. That makes it\n\nall the more surprising that he treats the multiplicities of the unconscious\n\nthe way he does. For him, there will always be a reduction to the One: the\nlittle\n\nscars, the little holes, become subdivisions of the great scar or supreme\n\nhole named castration; the wolves become substitutes for a single Father\n\nwho turns up everywhere, or wherever they put him. (As Ruth Mack\n\nBrunswick says, Let's go all the way, the wolves are _\"all _the fathers and\ndoc-\n\ntors\" in the world; but the Wolf-Man thinks, \"You trying to tell me my ass\n\nisn't a wolf?\")\n\nWhat should have been done is the opposite, all of this should be under-\n\nstood in intensity: the Wolf is the pack, in other words, the multiplicity\n\ninstantaneously apprehended as such insofar as it approaches or moves\n\naway from zero, each distance being nondecomposable. Zero is the body\n\nwithout organs of the Wolf-Man. If the unconscious knows nothing of\n\nnegation, it is because there is nothing negative in the unconscious, only\n\nindefinite moves toward and away from zero, which does not at all express\n\nlack but rather the positivity of the full body as support and prop (\"for an\n\nafflux is necessary simply to signify the absence of intensity\"). The wolves\n\ndesignate an intensity, a band of intensity, a threshold of intensity on the\n\nWolf-Man's body without organs. A dentist told the Wolf-Man that he\n\n\"would soon lose all his teeth because of the violence of his bite\"\u2014and that\n\nhis gums were pocked with pustules and little holes.\n\n4\n\nJaw as high intensity,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)053.png)\n\n3\n\n2 \u25a1 1914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES?\n\nteeth as low intensity, and pustular gums as approach to zero. The wolf, as\n\nthe instantaneous apprehension of a multiplicity in a given region, is not a\n\nrepresentative, a substitute, but an _I feel. _I feel myself becoming a wolf,\none\n\nwolf among others, on the edge of the pack. A cry of anguish, the only one\n\nFreud hears: Help me not become wolf (or the opposite, Help me not fail in\n\nthis becoming). It is not a question of representation: don't think for a min-\n\nute that it has to do with believing oneself a wolf, representing oneself as a\n\nwolf. The wolf, wolves, are intensities, speeds, temperatures,\n\nnondecom-posable variable distances. A swarming, a wolfing. Who could\n\never believe that the anal machine bears no relation to the wolf machine, or\n\nthat the two are only linked by an Oedipal apparatus, by the all-too-human\n\nfigure of the Father? For in the end the anus also expresses an intensity, in\n\nthis case the approach to zero of a distance that cannot be decomposed\n\nwithout its elements changing in nature. _Afield of anuses, just like a pack\nof  \nwolves. _Does not the child, on the periphery, hold onto the wolves by his\n\nanus? The jaw descends to the anus. Hold onto those wolves by your jaw\n\nand your anus. The jaw is not a wolf jaw, it's not that simple; jaw and wolf\n\nform a multiplicity that is transformed into eye and wolf, anus and wolf,\n\nas a function of other distances, at other speeds, with other multiplicities,\n\nbetween thresholds. Lines of flight or of deterritorialization,\n\nbecoming-wolf, becoming-inhuman, deterritorialized intensities: that is\n\nwhat multiplicity is. To become wolf or to become hole is to\n\ndeterritorialize oneself following distinct but entangled lines. A hole is no\n\nmore negative than a wolf. Castration, lack, substitution: a tale told by an\n\noverconscious idiot who has no understanding of multiplicities as\n\nformations of the unconscious. A wolf is a hole, they are both particles of\n\nthe unconscious, nothing but particles, productions of particles, particulate\n\npaths, as elements of molecular multiplicities. It is not even sufficient to\n\nsay that intense and moving particles pass through holes; a hole is just as\n\nmuch a particle as what passes through it. Physicists say that holes are not\n\nthe absence of particles but particles traveling faster than the speed of\n\nlight. Flying anuses, speeding vaginas, there is no castration.\n\nLet us return to the story _of multiplicity, _for the creation of this\nsubstan-\n\ntive marks a very important moment. It was created precisely in order to\n\nescape the abstract opposition between the multiple and the one, to escape\n\ndialectics, to succeed in conceiving the multiple in the pure state, to cease\n\ntreating it as a numerical fragment of a lost Unity or Totality or as the\n\norganic element of a Unity or Totality yet to come, and instead distinguish\n\nbetween different types of multiplicity. Thus we find in the work of the\n\nmathematician and physicist Riemann a distinction between discreet mul-\n\ntiplicities and continuous multiplicities (the metrical principle of the sec-\n\nond kind of multiplicity resides solely in forces at work within them). Then\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)054.png)\n\n1\n\n914: ONE OR SEVERAL WOLVES? D 33\n\nin Meinong and Russell we find a distinction between multiplicities of\n\nmagnitude or divisibility, which are extensive, and multiplicities of dis-\n\ntance, which are closer to the intensive. And in Bergson there is a distinc-\n\ntion between numerical or extended multiplicities and qualitative or\n\ndurational multiplicities. We are doing approximately the same thing\n\nwhen we distinguish between arborescent multiplicities and rhizomatic\n\nmultiplicities. Between macro- and micromultiplicities. On the one hand,\n\nmultiplicities that are extensive, divisible, and molar; unifiable,\n\ntotal-izable, organizable; conscious or preconscious\u2014and on the other\n\nhand, libidinal, unconscious, molecular, intensive multiplicities\n\ncomposed of particles that do not divide without changing in nature, and\n\ndistances that do not vary without entering another multiplicity and that\n\nconstantly construct and dismantle themselves in the course of their\n\ncommunications, as they cross over into each other at, beyond, or before\n\na certain threshold. The elements of this second kind of multiplicity are\n\nparticles; their relations are distances; their movements are Brownian;\n\ntheir quantities are intensities, differences in intensity.\n\nThis only provides the logical foundation. Elias Canetti distinguishes\n\nbetween two types of multiplicity that are sometimes opposed but at other\n\ntimes interpenetrate: mass (\"crowd\") multiplicities and pack multiplici-\n\nties. Among the characteristics of a mass, in Canetti's sense, we should note\n\nlarge quantity, divisibility and equality of the members, concentration,\n\nsociability of the aggregate as a whole, one-way hierarchy, organization of\n\nterritoriality or territorialization, and emission of signs. Among the char-\n\nacteristics of a pack are small or restricted numbers, dispersion,\n\nnonde-composable variable distances, qualitative metamorphoses,\n\ninequalities as remainders or crossings, impossibility of a fixed\n\ntotalization or hierar-chization, a Brownian variability in directions, lines\n\nof deterritorial-ization, and projection of particles.\n\n5\n\nDoubtless, there is no\n\nmore equality or any less hierarchy in packs than in masses, but they are\n\nof a different kind. The leader of the pack or the band plays move by\n\nmove, must wager everything every hand, whereas the group or mass\n\nleader consolidates or capitalizes on past gains. The pack, even on its own\n\nturf, is constituted by a line of flight or of deterritorialization that is a\n\ncomponent part of it, and to which it accredits a high positive value,\n\nwhereas masses only integrate these lines in order to segment them,\n\nobstruct them, ascribe them a negative sign. Canetti notes that in a pack\n\neach member is alone even in the company of others (for example,\n\nwolves on the hunt); each takes care of himself at the same time as\n\nparticipating in the band. \"In the changing constellation of the pack, in its\n\ndances and expeditions, he will again and again find himself at its edge.\n\nHe may be in the center, and then, immediately afterwards, at the edge\n\nagain; at the edge and then back in the center.

As opposed to the paranoid position\n\nof the mass subject, with all the identifications of the individual with the\n\ngroup, the group with the leader, and the leader with the group; be securely\n\nembedded in the mass, get close to the center, never be at the edge except in\n\nthe line of duty. Why assume (as does Konrad Lorenz, for example) that\n\nbands and their type of companionship represent a more rudimentary evo-\n\nlutionary state than group societies or societies of conjugality? Not only do\n\nthere exist bands of humans, but there are particularly refined examples:\n\n\"high-society life\" differs from \"sociality\" in that it is closer to the pack.\n\nSocial persons have a certain envious and erroneous image of the\n\nhigh-society person because they are ignorant of high-society positions and\n\nhierarchies, the relations of force, the very particular ambitions and\n\nprojects. High-society relations are never coextensive with social\n\nrelations, they do not coincide. Even \"mannerisms\" (all bands have them)\n\nare specific to micromultiplicities and distinct from social manners or\n\ncustoms.\n\nThere is no question, however, of establishing a dualist opposition\n\nbetween the two types of multiplicities, molecular machines and molar\n\nmachines', that would be no better than the dualism between the One and\n\nthe multiple. There are only multiplicities of multiplicities forming a single  \n_assemblage, _operating in the same _assemblage: _packs in masses and masses\n\nin packs. Trees have rhizome lines, and the rhizome points of\n\narbor-escence. How could mad particles be produced with anything but a\n\ngigantic cyclotron? How could lines of deterritorialization be assignable\n\noutside of circuits of territoriality? Where else but in wide expanses, and\n\nin major upheavals in those expanses, could a tiny rivulet of new intensity\n\nsuddenly start to flow?

In Kafka, it is impossible to separate the\n\nerection of a great paranoid bureaucratic machine from the installation of\n\nlittle schizo machines of becoming-dog or becoming-beetle. In the case\n\nof the Wolf-Man, it is impossible to separate the becoming-wolf of his\n\ndream from the military and religious organization of his obsessions. A\n\nmilitary man does a wolf; a military man does a dog. There are not two\n\nmultiplicities or two machines; one and the same machinic assemblage\n\nproduces and distributes the whole, in other words, the set of statements\n\ncorresponding to the \"complex.\" What does psychoanalysis have to say\n\nabout all of this?

Even Brunswick can't go wrong:\n\nalthough she recognizes herself in the big woman, she does see that this\n\ntime the wolves are Bolsheviks, the revolutionary mass that had emptied\n\nthe dresser and confiscated the Wolf-Man's fortune. _The wolves, in a  \nmetastable state, have gone over to a large-scale social machin_e But psycho-\n\nanalysis has nothing to say about all of these points\u2014except what Freud\n\nalready said: it all leads back to daddy (what do you know, he was one of the\n\nleaders of the liberal party in Russia, but that's hardly important; all that\n\nneeds to be said is that the revolution \"assuaged the patient's feelings of\n\nguilt\"). You'd think that the investments and counterinvestments of the\n\nlibido had nothing to do with mass disturbances, pack movements, collec-\n\ntive signs, and particles of desire.\n\nThus it does not suffice to attribute molar multiplicities and mass\n\nmachines to the preconscious, reserving another kind of machine or multi-\n\nplicity for the unconscious. For it is the assemblage of both of these that is\n\nthe province of the unconscious, the way in which the former condition the\n\nlatter, and the latter prepare the way for the former, or elude them or return\n\nto them: the libido suffuses everything. Keep everything in sight at the\n\nsame time\u2014that a social machine or an organized mass has a molecular\n\nunconscious that marks not only its tendency to decompose but also the\n\ncurrent components of its very operation and organization; that any indi-\n\nvidual caught up in a mass has his/her own pack unconscious, which does\n\nnot necessarily resemble the packs of the mass to which that individual\n\nbelongs; that an individual or mass will live out in its unconscious the\n\nmasses and packs of another mass or another individual. What does it\n\nmean to love somebody? It is always to seize that person in a mass, extract\n\nhim or her from a group, however small, in which he or she participates,\n\nwhether it be through the family only or through something else; then to\n\nfind that person's own packs, the multiplicities he or she encloses within\n\nhimself or herself which may be of an entirely different nature. To join\n\nthem to mine, to make them penetrate mine, and for me to penetrate the\n\nother person's. Heavenly nuptials, multiplicities of multiplicities. Every\n\nlove is an exercise in depersonalization on a body without organs yet to be\n\nformed, and it is at the highest point of this depersonalization that some-\n\none can be _named, _receives his or her family name or first name, acquires\n\nthe most intense discernibility in the instantaneous apprehension of the\n\nmultiplicities belonging to him or her, and to which he or she belongs.

The\n\ndistinction to be made is not at all between exterior and interior, which\n\nare always relative, changing, and reversible, but between different types\n\nof multiplicities that coexist, interpenetrate, and change places\u2014\n\nmachines, cogs, motors, and elements that are set in motion at a given\n\nmoment, forming an assemblage productive of statements: \"I love you\" (or\n\nwhatever). For Kafka, Felice is inseparable from a certain social machine,\n\nand, as a representative of the firm that manufactures them, from\n\nparlograph machines; how could she not belong to that organization in the\n\neyes of Kafka, a man fascinated by commerce and bureaucracy? But at the\n\nsame time, Felice's teeth, her big carnivorous teeth, send her racing down\n\nother lines, into the molecular multiplicities of a becoming-dog, a\n\nbecoming-jackal . .. Felice is inseparable from the sign of the modern\n\nsocial machines belonging to her, from those belonging to Kafka (not the\n\nsame ones), and from the particles, the little molecular machines, the\n\nwhole strange becoming or journey Kafka will make and have her make\n\nthrough his perverse writing apparatus.\n\nThere are no individual statements, only statement-producing\n\nma-chinic assemblages. We say that the assemblage is fundamentally\n\nlibidinal and unconscious. It is the unconscious in person. For the moment,\n\nwe will note that assemblages have elements (or multiplicities) of several\n\nkinds: human, social, and technical machines, organized molar machines;\n\nmolecular machines with their particles of becoming-inhuman; Oedipal\n\napparatuses _(yes, of course there are Oedipal statements, many of them); _\n\nand counter-Oedipal apparatuses, variable in aspect and functioning. We\n\nwill go into it later. We can no longer even speak of distinct machines,\n\nonly of types of interpenetrating multiplicities that at any given moment\n\nform a single machinic assemblage, the faceless figure of the libido. Each\n\nof us is caught up in an assemblage of this kind, and we reproduce its\n\nstatements when we think we are speaking in our own name; or rather we\n\nspeak in our own name when we produce its statement.

In\n\ntruth, Freud sees nothing and understands nothing. He has no idea what a\n\nlibidinal assemblage is, with all the machineries it brings into play, all the\n\nmultiple loves.\n\nOf course, there are Oedipal statements. For example, Kafka's story,\n\n\"Jackals and Arabs,\" is easy to read in that way: you can always do it, you\n\ncan't lose, it works every time, even if you understand nothing. The Arabs\n\nare clearly associated with the father and the jackals with the mother;\n\nbetween the two, there is a whole story of castration represented by the\n\nrusty scissors. But it so happens that the Arabs are an extensive, armed,\n\norganized mass stretching across the entire desert; and the jackals are an\n\nintense pack forever launching into the desert following lines of flight or\n\ndeterritorialization (\"they are madmen, veritable madmen\"); between the\n\ntwo, at the edge, the Man of the North, the jackal-man. And aren't those big\n\nscissors the Arab sign that guides or releases jackal-particles, both to\naccel-\n\nerate their mad race by detaching them from the mass and to bring them\n\nback to the mass, to tame them and whip them, to bring them around?\n\nDead camel: Oedipal food apparatus. Counter-Oedipal carrion apparatus:\n\nkill animals to eat, or eat to clean up carrion. The jackals formulate the\n\nproblem well: it is not that of castration but of \"cleanliness\" _(proprete,\n_also\n\n\"ownness\"), the test of desert-desire. Which will prevail, mass territoriality\n\nor pack deterritorialization? The libido suffuses the entire desert, the body\n\nwithout organs on which the drama is played out.\n\nThere are no individual statements, there never are. Every statement is\n\nthe product of a machinic assemblage, in other words, of collective agents\n\nof enunciation (take \"collective agents\" to mean not peoples or societies\n\nbut multiplicities).

What does psychoanalysis know about\n\nmultiplication? The desert hour when the dromedary becomes a thousand\n\ndromedaries snickering in the sky. The evening hour when a thousand\n\nholes appear on the surface of the earth. Castration! Castration! cries the\n\npsychoanalytic scarecrow, who never saw more than a hole, a father or a\n\ndog where wolves are, a domesticated individual where there are wild mul-\n\ntiplicities. We are not just criticizing psychoanalysis for having selected\n\nOedipal statements exclusively. For such statements are to a certain extent\n\npart of a machinic assemblage, for which they could serve as correctional\n\nindexes, as in a calculation of errors. We are criticizing psychoanalysis for\n\nhaving used Oedipal enunciation to make patients believe they would pro-\n\nduce individual, personal statements, and would finally speak in their own\n\nname. The trap was set from the start: never will the Wolf-Man speak. Talk\n\nas he might about wolves, howl as he might like a wolf, Freud does not even\n\nlisten; he glances at his dog and answers, \"It's daddy.\" For as long as that\n\nlasts, Freud calls it neurosis; when it cracks, it's psychosis. The Wolf-Man\n\nwill receive the psychoanalytic medal of honor for services rendered to the\n\ncause, and even disabled veterans' benefits. He could have spoken in his\n\nown name only if the machinic assemblage that was producing particular\n\nstatements in him had been brought to light. But there is no question of that\n\nin psychoanalysis: at the very moment the subject is persuaded that he or\n\nshe will be uttering the most individual of statements, he or she is deprived\n\nof all basis for enunciation. Silence people, prevent them from speaking,\n\nand above all, when they do speak, pretend they haven't said a thing: the\n\nfamous psychoanalytic neutrality. The Wolf-Man keeps howling: Six\n\nwolves! Seven wolves! Freud says, How's that? Goats, you say? How inter-\n\nesting. Take away the goats and all you have left is a wolf, so it's your\n\nfather ... That is why the Wolf-Man feels so fatigued: he's left lying there\n\nwith all his wolves in his throat, all those little holes on his nose, and all\n\nthose libidi-nal values on his body without organs. The war will come, the\n\nwolves will become Bolsheviks, and the Wolf-Man will remain suffocated\n\nby all he had to say. All we will be told is that he became well behaved,\n\npolite, and resigned again, \"honest and scrupulous.\" In short, cured. He\n\ngets back by pointing out that psychoanalysis lacks a truly zoological\n\nvision: \"Nothing can be more valuable for a young person than the love of\n\nnature and a comprehension of the natural sciences, in particular\n\nzoology.\"\n\n7\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)060.png)\n\n3\\. 10,000\n\nB\n\n.\n\nC\n\n:\n\nThe Geology of Morals\n\n(Who Does the Earth Think It Is?)\n\nDouble Articulation\n\n39\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)061.png)\n\n4\n\n0 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nThe same Professor Challenger who made the Earth scream with his pain\n\nmachine, as described by Arthur Conan Doyle, gave a lecture after mixing\n\nseveral textbooks on geology and biology in a fashion befitting his simian\n\ndisposition. He explained that the Earth\u2014the Deterritorialized, the\n\nGlacial, the giant Molecule\u2014is a body without organs. This body without\n\norgans is permeated by unformed, unstable matters, by flows in all direc-\n\ntions, by free intensities or nomadic singularities, by mad or transitory par-\n\nticles. That, however, was not the question at hand. For there simultane-\n\nously occurs upon the earth a very important, inevitable phenomenon that\n\nis beneficial in many respects and unfortunate in many others: stratifica-\n\ntion. Strata are Layers, Belts. They consist of giving form to matters, of\n\nimprisoning intensities or locking singularities into systems of resonance\n\nand redundancy, of producing upon the body of the earth molecules large\n\nand small and organizing them into molar aggregates. Strata are acts of\n\ncapture, they are like \"black holes\" or occlusions striving to seize whatever\n\ncomes within their reach.\n\n1\n\nThey operate by coding and territorialization\n\nupon the earth; they proceed simultaneously by code and by territoriality.\n\nThe strata are judgments of God; stratification in general is the entire sys-\n\ntem of the judgment of God (but the earth, or the body without organs, con-\n\nstantly eludes that judgment, flees and becomes destratified, decoded,\n\ndeterritorialized).\n\nChallenger quoted a sentence he said he came across in a geology text-\n\nbook. He said we needed to learn it by heart because we would only be in a\n\nposition to understand it later on: \"A surface of stratification is a more\n\ncompact plane of consistency lying between two layers.\" The layers are the\n\nstrata. They come at least in pairs, one serving as _substratum _for the\nother.\n\nThe surface of stratification is a machinic assemblage distinct from the\n\nstrata. The assemblage is between two layers, between two strata; on one\n\nside it faces the strata (in this direction, the assemblage is an\n_interstratum), _\n\nbut the other side faces something else, the body without organs or plane of\n\nconsistency (here, it is a _metastratum). _In effect, the body without organs\nis\n\nitself the plane of consistency, which becomes compact or thickens at the\n\nlevel of the strata.\n\nGod is a Lobster, or a double pincer, a double bind. Not only do strata\n\ncome at least in pairs, but in a different way each stratum is double (it\nitself\n\nhas several layers). Each stratum exhibits phenomena constitutive of _dou-  \nble articulation. _Articulate twice, B-A, BA. This is not at all to say that\nthe\n\nstrata speak or are language based. Double articulation is so extremely var-\n\niable that we cannot begin with a general model, only a relatively simple\n\ncase. The first articulation chooses or deducts, from unstable\n\nparticle-flows, metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units  \n_{substances) _upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and\n\nsuccessions _(forms)._\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)062.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 41\n\nThe second articulation establishes functional, compact, stable structures  \n_(forms), _and constructs the molar compounds in which these structures are\n\nsimultaneously actualized _{substances). _In a geological stratum, for exam-\n\nple, the first articulation is the process of \"sedimentation,\" which deposits\n\nunits of cyclic sediment according to a statistical order: flysch, with its\n\nsuccession of sandstone and schist. The second articulation is the \"fold-\n\ning\" that sets up a stable functional structure and effects the passage from\n\nsediment to sedimentary rock.\n\nIt is clear that the distinction between the two articulations is not\n\nbetween substances and forms. Substances are nothing other than formed\n\nmatters. Forms imply a code, modes of coding and decoding. Substances as\n\nformed matters refer to territorialities and degrees of territorialization and\n\ndeterritorialization. But each articulation has a code _and _a territoriality;\n\ntherefore each possesses both form and substance. For now, all we can say is\n\nthat each articulation has a corresponding type of segmentarity or multi-\n\nplicity: one type is supple, more molecular, and merely ordered; the other is\n\nmore rigid, molar, and organized. Although the first articulation is not\n\nlacking in systematic interactions, it is in the second articulation in\npartic-\n\nular that phenomena constituting an overcoding are produced, phenom-\n\nena of centering, unification, totalization, integration, hierarchization,\n\nand finalization. Both articulations establish binary relations between\n\ntheir respective segments. But between the segments of one articulation\n\nand the segments of the other there are biunivocal relationships obeying far\n\nmore complex laws. The word \"structure\" may be used to designate the\n\nsum of these relations and relationships, but it is an illusion to believe\nthat\n\nstructure is the earth's last word. Moreover, it cannot be taken for granted\n\nthat the distinction between the two articulations is always that of the\n\nmolecular and the molar.\n\nHe skipped over the immense diversity of the energetic,\n\nphysico-chemical, and geological strata. He went straight to the organic\n\nstrata, or the existence of a great organic stratification. The problem of\n\nthe organism\u2014_how to \"make\" the body an organism_\u2014is once again a\n\nproblem of articulation, of the articulatory relation. The Dogons, well\n\nknown to the professor, formulate the problem as follows: an organism\n\nbefalls the body of the smith, by virtue of a machine or machinic\n\nassemblage that stratifies it. \"The shock of the hammer and the anvil\n\nbroke his arms and legs at the elbows and knees, which until that\n\nmoment he had not possessed. In this way, he received the articulations\n\nspecific to the new human form that was to spread across the earth, a form\n\ndedicated to work.... His arm became folded with a view to work.\"\n\n2\n\nIt is\n\nobviously only a manner of speaking to limit the articulatory relation to\n\nthe bones.

This double articula-\n\ntion is internal to the molecular, it is the articulation between small and\n\nlarge molecules, a segmentarity by successive modifications and polymeri-\n\nzation. \"First, the elements taken from the medium are combined through\n\na series of transformations.. . .All this activity involves hundreds of chem-\n\nical reactions. But ultimately, it produces a limited number of small com-\n\npounds, a few dozen at most. In the second stage of cellular chemistry, the\n\nsmall molecules are assembled to produce larger ones. It is the polymeriza-\n\ntion of units linked end-to-end that forms the characteristic chains of\n\nmac-romolecules. . .. The two stages of cellular chemistry, therefore,\n\ndiffer in their function, products and nature. The first carves out chemical\n\nmotifs; the second assembles them.

In fact, Professor\n\nChallenger was double, articulated twice, and that did not make things any\n\neasier, people never knew which of him was present. He (?) claimed to have\n\ninvented a discipline he referred to by various names: rhizomatics,\n\nstratoanalysis, schizoanalysis, nomadology, micropolitics, pragmatics, the\n\nscience of multiplicities. Yet no one clearly understood what the goals,\n\nmethod, or principles of this discipline were. Young Professor Alasca,\n\nChallenger's pet student, tried hypocritically to defend him by explaining\n\nthat on a given stratum the passage from one articulation to the other was\n\neasily verified because it was always accompanied by a loss of water, in\n\ngenetics as in geology, and even in linguistics, where the importance of the\n\n\"lost saliva\" phenomenon is measured. Challenger took offense, preferring\n\nto cite his friend, as he called him, the Danish Spinozist geologist,\n\nHjelmslev, that dark prince descended from Hamlet who also made lan-\n\nguage his concern, precisely in order to analyze its \"stratification.\"\n\nHjelmslev was able to weave a net out of the notions _of matter, content _and  \n_expression,form _and _substance. _These were the strata, said Hjelmslev. Now\n\nthis net had the advantage of breaking with the form-content duality, since\n\nthere was a form of content no less than a form of expression. Hjelmslev's\n\nenemies saw this merely as a way of rebaptizing the discredited notions of\n\nthe signified and signifier, but something quite different was actually going\n\non. Despite what Hjelmslev himself may have said, the net is not linguistic\n\nin scope or origin (the same must be said of double articulation: if language\n\nhas a specificity of its own, as it most certainly does, that specificity con-\n\nsists neither in double articulation nor in Hjelmslev's net, which are gen-\n\neral characteristics of strata).\n\nHe used the term _matter _for the plane of consistency or Body without\n\nOrgans, in other words, the unformed, unorganized, nonstratified, or\n\ndestratified body and all its flows: subatomic and submolecular particles,\n\npure intensities, prevital and prephysical free singularities.

The distinction between content and expression is _always  \nreal, _in various ways, but it cannot be said that the terms preexist their\ndou-\n\nble articulation. It is the double articulation that distributes them accord-\n\ning to the line it draws in each stratum; it is what constitutes their real\n\ndistinction. (On the other hand, there is no real distinction between form\n\nand substance, only a mental or modal distinction: since substances are\n\nnothing other than formed matters, formless substances are inconceivable,\n\nalthough it is possible in certain instances to conceive of substanceless\n\nforms.)\n\nEven though there is a real distinction between them, content and\n\nexpression are relative terms (\"first\" and \"second\" articulation should also\n\nbe understood in an entirely relative fashion). Even though it is capable of\n\ninvariance, expression is just as much a variable as content. Content and\n\nexpression are two variables of a function of stratification. They not only\n\nvary from one stratum to another, but intermingle, and within the same\n\nstratum multiply and divide ad infinitum. Since every articulation is dou-\n\nble, there is not an articulation of content _and _an articulation of\n\nexpression\u2014the articulation of content is double in its own right and con-\n\nstitutes a relative expression within content; the articulation of expression\n\nis also double and constitutes a relative content within expression. For this\n\nreason, there exist _intermediate states _between content and expression,\n\nexpression and content: the levels, equilibriums, and exchanges through\n\nwhich a stratified system passes. In short, we find forms and substances of\n\ncontent that play the role of expression in relation to other forms and sub-\n\nstances, and conversely for expression. These new distinctions do not,\n\ntherefore, coincide with the distinction between forms and substances\n\nwithin each articulation; instead, they show that each articulation is\n\nalready, or still, double. This can be seen on the organic stratum: proteins\n\nof content have two forms, one of which (the infolded fiber) plays the role\n\nof functional expression in relation to the other. The same goes for the\n\nnucleic acids of expression: double articulations cause certain formal and\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)066.png)\n\n10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 45\n\nsubstantial elements to play the role of content in relation to others; not\n\nonly does the half of the chain that is reproduced become a content, but the\n\nreconstituted chain itself becomes a content in relation to the \"messenger.\"\n\nThere are double pincers everywhere on a stratum; everywhere and in all\n\ndirections there are double binds and lobsters, a multiplicity of double\n\narticulations affecting both expression and content. Through all of this,\n\nHjelmslev's warning should not be forgotten: \"The terms expression plane\n\nand content plane ... are chosen in conformity with established notions\n\nand are quite arbitrary. Their functional definition provides no justifica-\n\ntion for calling one, and not the other, of these entities _expression, _or\none,\n\nand not the other, _content. _They are defined only by their mutual\nsolidarity,\n\nand neither of them can be identified otherwise. They are defined only\n\noppositively and relatively, as mutually opposed functives of one and the\n\nsame function.\"\n\n6\n\nWe must combine all the resources of real distinction,\n\nreciprocal presupposition, and general relativism.\n\nThe question we must ask is what on a given stratum varies and what\n\ndoes not. What accounts for the unity and diversity of a stratum? Matter,\n\nthe pure matter of the plane of consistency (or inconsistency) lies outside\n\nthe strata. The molecular materials borrowed from the substrata may be\n\nthe same throughout a stratum, but that does not mean that the molecules\n\nwill be the same. The substantial elements may be the same throughout the\n\nstratum without the substances being the same. The formal relations or\n\nbonds may be the same without the forms being the same. In biochemistry,\n\nthere is a _unity of composition _of the organic stratum defined at the level\nof\n\nmaterials and energy, substantial elements or radicals, bonds and reac-\n\ntions. But there is a variety of different molecules, substances, and forms.\n\nShould we not sing the praise of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire? For in the nine-\n\nteenth century he developed a grandiose conception of stratification. He\n\nsaid that matter, considered from the standpoint of its greatest divisibility,\n\nconsists in particles of decreasing size, flows or elastic fluids that \"deploy\n\nthemselves\" by radiating through space. Combustion is the process of this\n\nescape or infinite division on the plane of consistency. Electrification is\nthe\n\nopposite process, constitutive of strata; it is the process whereby similar\n\nparticles group together to form atoms and molecules, similar molecules to\n\nform bigger molecules, and the biggest molecules to form molar aggregates:\n\n\"the attraction of like by like,\" as in a double pincer or double\narticulation.\n\nThus there is no vital matter specific to the organic stratum, matter is the\n\nsame on all the strata. But the organic stratum does have a specific unity of\n\ncomposition, a single abstract Animal, a single machine embedded in the\n\nstratum, and presents everywhere the same molecular materials, the same\n\nelements or anatomical components of organs, the same formal connec-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)067.png)\n\n4\n\n6 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\ntions. Organic forms are nevertheless different from one another, as are\n\norgans, compound substances, and molecules. It is of little or no impor-\n\ntance that Geoffroy chose anatomical elements as the substantial units\n\nrather than protein and nucleic acid radicals. At any rate, he already\n\ninvoked a whole interplay of molecules. The important thing is the princi-\n\nple of the simultaneous unity and variety of the stratum: isomorphism of\n\nforms but no correspondence; identity of elements or components but no\n\nidentity of compound substances.\n\nThis is where the dialogue, or rather violent debate, with Cuvier came\n\nin. To keep the last of the audience from leaving, Challenger imagined a\n\nparticularly epistemological dialogue of the dead, in puppet theater style.\n\nGeoffroy called forth Monsters, Cuvier laid out all the Fossils in order,\n\nBaer flourished flasks filled with embryos, Vialleton put on a tetrapod's\n\nbelt, Perrier mimed the dramatic battle between the Mouth and the Brain,\n\nand so on. _Geoffroy: _The proof that there is isomorphism is that you can\n\nalways get from one form on the organic stratum to another, however dif-\n\nferent they may be, by means of \"folding.\" To go from the Vertebrate to the\n\nCephalopod, bring the two sides of the Vertebrate's backbone together,\n\nbend its head down to its feet and its pelvis up to the nape of its neck ...  \n_Cuvier _(angrily): That's just not true! You go from an Elephant to a\n\nMedusa; I know, I tried. There are irreducible axes, types, branches. There\n\nare resemblances between organs and analogies between forms, nothing\n\nmore. You're a falsifier, a metaphysician. _Vialleton _(a disciple of Cuvier\n\nand Baer): Even if folding gave good results, who could endure it? It's not\n\nby chance that Geoffroy only considers anatomical elements. No muscle or\n\nligament would survive it. _Geoffroy. _I said that there was isomorphism but\n\nnot correspondence. You have to bring \"degrees of development or perfec-\n\ntion\" into the picture. It is not everywhere on a stratum that materials\n\nreach the degree at which they form a given aggregate. Anatomical ele-\n\nments may be arrested or inhibited in certain places by molecular clashes,\n\nthe influence of the milieu, or pressure from neighbors to such an extent\n\nthat they compose different organs. The same formal relations or connec-\n\ntions are then effectuated in entirely different forms and arrangements. It\n\nis still the same abstract Animal that is realized throughout the stratum,\n\nonly to varying degrees, in varying modes. Each time, it is as perfect as its\n\nsurroundings or milieu allows it to be (it is obviously not yet a question of\n\nevolution: neither folding nor degrees imply descent or derivation, only\n\nautonomous realizations of the same abstract relations). This is where\n\nGeoffroy invoked Monsters: human monsters are embryos that were\n\nretarded at a certain degree of development, the human in them is only a\n\nstraitjacket for inhuman forms and substances. Yes, the Heteradelph is a\n\ncrustacean. _Baer _(an ally of Cuvier and contemporary of Darwin, about\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)068.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 47\n\nwhom he had reservations, in addition to being an enemy of Geoffroy):\n\nThat's not true, you can't confuse degrees of development with types of\n\nforms. A single type has several degrees, a single degree is found in several\n\ntypes, but never will you make types out of degrees. An embryo of one type\n\ncannot display another type; at most, it can be of the same degree as an\n\nembryo of the second type. _Vialleton _(a disciple of Baer's who took both\n\nDarwin and Geoffroy one further): And then there are things that only an\n\nembryo can do or endure. It can do or endure these things precisely because\n\nof its type, not because it can go from one type to another according to\n\ndegrees of development. Admire the Tortoise. Its neck requires that a cer-\n\ntain number of protovertebrae change position, and its front limbs must\n\nslide 180 degrees in relation to that of a bird. You can never draw conclu-\n\nsions about phylogenesis on the basis of embryogenesis. Folding does not\n\nmake it possible to go from one type to another; quite the contrary, the\n\ntypes testify to the irreducibility of the forms of folding ... (Thus\nVialleton\n\npresented two kinds of interconnected arguments in the service of the same\n\ncause, saying first that there are things no animal can do by reason of its\n\nsubstance, and then that there are things that only an embryo can do by rea-\n\nson of its form. Two strong arguments.)\n\n7\n\nWe're a little lost now. There is so much going on in these retorts. So\n\nmany endlessly proliferating distinctions. So much getting even, for\n\nepiste-mology is not innocent. The sweet and subtle Geoffroy and the\n\nviolent and serious Cuvier do battle around Napoleon. Cuvier, the rigid\n\nspecialist, is pitted against Geoffroy, always ready to switch specialities.\n\nCuvier hates Geoffroy, he can't stomach Geoffroy's lighthearted\n\nformulas, his humor (yes, Hens do indeed have teeth, the Lobster has\n\nskin on its bones, etc.). Cuvier is a man of Power and Terrain, and he\n\nwon't let Geoffroy forget it; Geoffroy, on the other hand, prefigures the\n\nnomadic man of speed. Cuvier reflects a Euclidean space, whereas\n\nGeoffroy thinks topologically. Today let us invoke the folds of the cortex\n\nwith all their paradoxes. Strata are topological, and Geoffroy is a great\n\nartist of the fold, a formidable artist; as such, he already has a\n\npresentiment of a certain kind of animal rhizome with aberrant paths of\n\ncommunication\u2014Monsters. Cuvier reacts in terms of discontinuous\n\nphotographs, and casts of fossils. But we're a little lost, because\n\ndistinctions have proliferated in all directions.\n\nWe have not even taken Darwin, evolutionism, or neoevolutionism into\n\naccount yet. This, however, is where a decisive phenomenon occurs: our\n\npuppet theater becomes more and more nebulous, in other words, collec-\n\ntive and differential. Earlier, we invoked two factors, and their uncertain\n\nrelations, in order to explain the diversity within a stratum\u2014degrees of\n\ndevelopment or perfection and types of forms. They now undergo a pro-\n\nfound transformation. There is a double tendency for types of forms to be\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)069.png)\n\n4\n\n8 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nunderstood increasingly in terms of populations, packs and colonies,\n\ncollectivities or multiplicities; and degrees of development in terms of\n\nspeeds, rates, coefficients, and differential relations. A double deepening.\n\nThis, Darwinism's fundamental contribution, implies a new coupling of\n\nindividuals and milieus on the stratum.\n\n8\n\nFirst, if we assume the presence of an elementary or even molecular pop-\n\nulation in a given milieu, the forms do not preexist the population, they are\n\nmore like statistical results. The more a population assumes divergent\n\nforms, the more its multiplicity divides into multiplicities of different\n\nnature, the more its elements form distinct compounds or matters\u2014the\n\nmore efficiently it distributes itself in the milieu, or divides up the\nmilieu.\n\nThus the relationship between embryogenesis and phylogenesis is\n\nreversed: the embryo does not testify to an absolute form preestablished in\n\na closed milieu; rather, the phylogenesis of populations has at its disposal,\n\nin an open milieu, an entire range of relative forms to choose from, none of\n\nwhich is preestablished. In embryogenesis, \"It is possible to tell from the\n\nparents, anticipating the outcome of the process, whether a pigeon or a wolf\n\nis developing.... But here the points of reference themselves are in\n\nmotion: there are only fixed points for convenience of expression. At the\n\nlevel of universal evolution, it is impossible to discern that kind of refer-\n\nence point.... Life on earth appears as a sum of relatively independent\n\nspecies of flora and fauna with sometimes shifting or porous boundaries\n\nbetween them. Geographical areas can only harbor a sort of chaos, or, at\n\nbest, extrinsic harmonies of an ecological order, temporary equilibriums\n\nbetween populations.\"\n\n9\n\nSecond, simultaneously and under the same conditions, the degrees are\n\nnot degrees of preexistent development or perfection but are instead global\n\nand relative equilibriums: they enter into play as a function of the advan-\n\ntage they give particular elements, then a particular multiplicity in the\n\nmilieu, and as a function of a particular variation in the milieu. Degrees are\n\nno longer measured in terms of increasing perfection or a differentiation\n\nand increase in the complexity of the parts, but in terms of differential\nrela-\n\ntions and coefficients such as selective pressure, catalytic action, speed of\n\npropagation, rate of growth, evolution, mutation, etc. Relative progress,\n\nthen, can occur by formal and quantitative simplification rather than by\n\ncomplication, by a loss of components and syntheses rather than by acqui-\n\nsition (it is a question of speed, and speed is a differential). It is through\n\npopulations that one is formed, assumes forms, and through loss that one\n\nprogresses and picks up speed. Darwinism's two fundamental contribu-\n\ntions move in the direction of a science of multiplicities: the substitution\nof\n\npopulations for types, and the substitution of rates or differential relations\n\nfor degrees.\n\n10\n\nThese are nomadic contributions with shifting boundaries\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)070.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 49\n\ndetermined by populations or variations of multiplicities, and with differ-\n\nential coefficients or variations of relations. Contemporary biochemistry,\n\nor \"molecular Darwinism\" as Monod calls it, confirms, on the level of a\n\nsingle statistical and global individual, or a simple sample, the decisive\n\nimportance of molecular populations and microbiological rates (for exam-\n\nple, the endlessness of the sequence composing a chain, and the chance var-\n\niation of a single segment in the sequence).\n\nChallenger admitted having digressed at length but added that there was\n\nno possible way to distinguish between the digressive and the\n\nnondi-gressive. The point was to arrive at several conclusions\n\nconcerning the unity and diversity of a single stratum, in this case the\n\norganic stratum.\n\nTo begin with, a stratum does indeed have a unity of composition, which\n\nis what allows it to be called _a _stratum: molecular materials, substantial\nele-\n\nments, and formal relations or traits. Materials are not the same as the\n\nunformed matter of the plane of consistency; they are already stratified,\n\nand come from \"substrata.\" But of course substrata should not be thought\n\nof only as substrata: in particular, their organization is no less complex\n\nthan, nor is it inferior to, that of the strata; we should be on our guard\n\nagainst any kind of ridiculous cosmic evolutionism. The materials fur-\n\nnished by a substratum are no doubt simpler than the compounds of a stra-\n\ntum, but their level of organization in the substratum is no lower than that\n\nof the stratum itself. The difference between materials and substantial ele-\n\nments is one of organization; there is a change in organization, not an aug-\n\nmentation. The materials furnished by the substratum constitute an  \n_exterior milieu _for the elements and compounds of the stratum under con-\n\nsideration, but they are not exterior _to _the stratum. The elements and com-\n\npounds constitute an interior of the stratum, just as the materials\n\nconstitute an exterior _of the _stratum; both belong to the stratum, the\nlatter\n\nbecause they are materials that have been furnished to the stratum and\n\nselected for it, the former because they are formed from the materials.\n\nOnce again, this exterior and interior are relative; they exist only through\n\ntheir exchanges and therefore only by virtue of the stratum responsible for\n\nthe relation between them. For example, on a crystalline stratum, the\n\namorphous milieu, or medium, is exterior to the seed before the crystal has\n\nformed; the crystal forms by interiorizing and incorporating masses of\n\namorphous material. Conversely, the interiority of the seed of the crystal\n\nmust move out to the system's exterior, where the amorphous medium can\n\ncrystallize (the aptitude to switch over to the other form of organization).\n\nTo the point that the seed itself comes from the outside. In short, both exte-\n\nrior and interior are interior to the stratum. The same applies to the organic\n\nstratum: the materials furnished by the substrata are an exterior medium\n\nconstituting the famous prebiotic soup, and catalysts play the role of seed\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)071.png)\n\n5\n\n0 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nin the formation of interior substantial elements or even compounds.\n\nThese elements and compounds both appropriate materials and exteri-\n\norize themselves through replication, even in the conditions of the primor-\n\ndial soup itself. Once again, interior and exterior exchange places, and both\n\nare interior to the organic stratum. The limit between them is the mem-\n\nbrane that regulates the exchanges and transformation in organization (in\n\nother words, the distributions interior to the stratum) and that defines all\n\nof the stratum's formal relations or traits (even though the situation and\n\nrole of the limit vary widely depending on the stratum, for example, the\n\nlimit of the crystal as compared to the cellular membrane). We may there-\n\nfore use the term central layer, or central ring, for the following aggregate\n\ncomprising the unity of composition of a stratum: exterior molecular\n\nmaterials, interior substantial elements, and the limit or membrane con-\n\nveying the formal relations. There is a single _abstract machine _that is\nenvel-\n\noped by the stratum and constitutes its unity. This is the Ecumenon, as\n\nopposed to the Planomenon of the plane of consistency.\n\nIt would be a mistake to believe that it is possible to isolate this unitary,\n\ncentral layer of the stratum, or to grasp it in itself, by regression. In the\nfirst\n\nplace, a stratum necessarily goes from layer to layer, and from the very\n\nbeginning. It already has several layers. It goes from a center to a\nperiphery,\n\nat the same time as the periphery reacts back upon the center to form a new\n\ncenter in relation to a new periphery. Flows constantly radiate outward,\n\nthen turn back. There is an outgrowth and multiplication of intermediate\n\nstates, and this process is one of the local conditions of the central ring\n\n(different concentrations, variations that are tolerated below a certain\n\nthreshold of identity). These intermediate states present new figures of\n\nmilieus or materials, as well as of elements and compounds. They are inter-\n\nmediaries between the exterior milieu and the interior element, substantial\n\nelements and their compounds, compounds and substances, and between\n\nthe different formed substances (substances of content and substances of\n\nexpression). We will use the term _epistrata _for these intermediaries and\n\nsuperpositions, these outgrowths, these levels. Returning to our two exam-\n\nples, on the crystalline stratum there are many intermediaries between the\n\nexterior milieu or material and the interior seed: a multiplicity of perfectly\n\ndiscontinuous states of metastability constituting so many hierarchical\n\ndegrees. Neither is the organic stratum separable from so-called interior\n\nmilieus that are interior elements in relation to exterior materials but also\n\nexterior elements in relation to interior substances.\" These internal\n\norganic milieus are known to regulate the degree of complexity or differen-\n\ntiation of the parts of an organism. A stratum, considered from the stand-\n\npoint of its unity of composition, therefore exists only in its substantial\n\nepistrata, which shatter its continuity, fragment its ring, and break it down\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)072.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 51\n\ninto gradations. The central ring does not exist independently of a periph-\n\nery that forms a new center, reacts back upon the first center, and in turn\n\ngives forth discontinuous epistrata.\n\nThat is not all. In addition to this new or second-degree relativity of inte-\n\nrior and exterior, there is a whole history on the level of the membrane or\n\nlimit. To the extent that elements and compounds incorporate or appropri-\n\nate materials, the corresponding organisms are forced to turn to other\n\n\"more foreign and less convenient\" materials that they take from still\n\nintact masses or other organisms. The milieu assumes a third figure here: it\n\nis no longer an interior or exterior milieu, even a relative one, nor an\ninter-\n\nmediate milieu, but instead an _annexed or associated milieu. _Associated\n\nmilieus imply sources of energy different from alimentary materials.\n\nBefore these sources are obtained, the organism can be said to nourish\n\nitself but not to breathe: it is in a state of suffocation.\n\n_n_\n\n_ _Obtaining an energy\n\nsource permits an increase in the number of materials that can be trans-\n\nformed into elements and compounds. The associated milieu is thus\n\ndefined by the capture of energy sources (respiration in the most general\n\nsense), by the discernment of materials, the sensing of their presence or\n\nabsence (perception), and by the fabrication or nonfabrication of the corre-\n\nsponding compounds (response, reaction). That there are molecular per-\n\nceptions no less than molecular reactions can be seen in the economy of the\n\ncell and the property of regulatory agents to \"recognize\" only one or two\n\nkinds of chemicals in a very diverse milieu of exteriority. The development\n\nof the associated milieus culminates in the animal worlds described by von\n\nUexkull, with all their active, perceptive, and energetic characteristics.\n\nThe unforgettable associated world of the Tick, defined by its gravitational\n\nenergy of falling, its olfactory characteristic of perceiving sweat, and its\n\nactive characteristic of latching on: the tick climbs a branch and drops onto\n\na passing mammal it has recognized by smell, then latches onto its skin (an\n\nassociated world composed of three factors, and no more). Active and per-\n\nceptive characteristics are themselves something of a double pincer, a dou-\n\nble articulation.\n\n13\n\nHere, the associated milieus are closely related to organic forms. An\n\norganic form is not a simple structure but a structuration, the constitution\n\nof an associated milieu. An animal milieu, such as the spider web, is no less\n\n\"morphogenetic\" than the form of the organism. One certainly cannot say\n\nthat the milieu determines the form; but to complicate things, this does not\n\nmake the relation between form and milieu any less decisive. Since the\n\nform depends on an autonomous code, it can only be constituted in an\n\nassociated milieu that interlaces active, perceptive, and energetic charac-\n\nteristics in a complex fashion, in conformity with the code's requirements;\n\nand the form can develop only through intermediary milieus that regulate\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)073.png)\n\n52 D 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nthe speeds and rates of its substances; and it can experience itself only in a\n\nmilieu of exteriority that measures the comparative advantages of the asso-\n\nciated milieus and the differential relations of the intermediary milieus.\n\nMilieus always act, through selection, on entire organisms, the forms of\n\nwhich depend on codes those milieus sanction indirectly. Associated\n\nmilieus divide a single milieu of exteriority among themselves as a func-\n\ntion of different forms, just as intermediate milieus divide a milieu of\n\nexteriority among themselves as a function of the rates or degrees of a sin-\n\ngle form. But the dividing is done differently in the two cases. In relation\nto\n\nthe central belt of the stratum, the intermediate strata or milieus constitute\n\n\"epistrata\" piled one atop the other, and form new centers for the new\n\nperipheries. We will apply the term \"parastrata\" to the second way in which\n\nthe central belt fragments into sides and \"besides,\" and the irreducible\n\nforms and milieus associated with them. This time, it is at the level of the\n\nlimit or membrane of the central belt that the formal relations or traits\n\ncommon to all of the strata necessarily assume entirely different forms or\n\ntypes of forms corresponding to the parastrata. A stratum exists only in its\n\nepistrata and parastrata, so that in the final analysis these must be consid-\n\nered strata in their own right. The ideally continuous belt or ring of the\n\nstratum\u2014the Ecumenon defined by the identity of molecular materials,\n\nsubstantial elements, and formal relations\u2014exists only as shattered, frag-\n\nmented into epistrata and parastrata that imply concrete machines and\n\ntheir respective indexes, and constitute different molecules, specific sub-\n\nstances, and irreducible forms.\n\n14\n\nWe may now return to the two fundamental contributions of Darwinism\n\nand answer the question of why forms or types of forms in the parastrata\n\nmust be understood in relation to populations, and degrees of develop-\n\nment in the epistrata as rates or differential relations. First, parastrata\n\nenvelop the very codes upon which the forms depend, and these codes nec-\n\nessarily apply to populations. There must already be an entire molecular\n\npopulation to be coded, and the effects of the code, or a change in the code,\n\nare evaluated in relation to a more or less molar population, depending on\n\nthe code's ability to propagate in the milieu or create for itself a new\nassoci-\n\nated milieu within which the modification will be popularizable. Yes, we\n\nmust always think in terms of packs and multiplicities: a code does or does\n\nnot take hold because the coded individual belongs to a certain population,\n\n\"the population inhabiting test tubes, a flask full of water, or a mammal's\n\nintestine.\" What does it mean to say that new forms and associated milieus\n\npotentially result from a change in the code, a modification of the code, or a\n\nvariation in the parastratum? The change is obviously not due to a passage\n\nfrom one preestablished form to another, in other words, a translation\n\nfrom one code to another. As long as the problem was formulated in that\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)074.png)\n\n10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 53\n\nfashion, it remained insoluble, and one would have to agree with Cuvier\n\nand Baer that established types of forms are irreducible and therefore do\n\nnot admit of translation or transformation. But as soon as it is recognized\n\nthat a code is inseparable from a process of decoding that is inherent to it,\n\nthe problem receives a new formulation. There is no genetics without\n\n\"genetic drift.\" The modern theory of mutations has clearly demonstrated\n\nthat a code, which necessarily relates to a population, has an essential mar-\n\ngin of decoding: not only does every code have supplements capable of free\n\nvariation, but a single segment may be copied twice, the second copy left\n\nfree for variation. In addition, fragments of code may be transferred from\n\nthe cells of one species to those of another, Man and Mouse, Monkey and\n\nCat, by viruses or through other procedures.

In truth, the epistrata are just as inseparable from the\n\nmovements that constitute them as the parastrata are from their\n\nprocesses. Nomadic waves or flows of deterritorialization go from the\n\ncentral layer to the periphery, then from the new center to the new\n\nperiphery, falling back to the old center and launching forth to the new.\n\n16\n\nThe organization of the epistrata moves in the direction of increasing\n\ndeterritorialization. Physical particles and chemical substances cross\n\nthresholds of deterritorialization on their own stratum and between strata;\n\nthese thresholds correspond to more or less stable intermediate states, to\n\nmore or less transitory valences and existences, to engagements with this\n\nor that other body, to densities of proximity, to more or less localizable\n\nconnections.

That is why degrees of development must be under-\n\nstood relatively, and as a function of differential speeds, relations, and\n\nrates. Deterritorialization must be thought of as a perfectly positive power\n\nthat has degrees and thresholds (epistrata), is always relative, and has\n\nreterritorialization as its flipside or complement. An organism that is\n\ndeterritorialized in relation to the exterior necessarily reterritorializes on\n\nits interior milieus. A given presumed fragment of embryo is deterrito-\n\nrialized when it changes thresholds or gradients, but is assigned a new role\n\nby the new surroundings. Local movements are alterations. Cellular migra-\n\ntion, stretching, invagination, folding are examples of this. Every voyage is\n\nintensive, and occurs in relation to thresholds of intensity between which it\n\nevolves or that it crosses. One travels by intensity; displacements and\n\nspatial figures depend on intensive thresholds of nomadic deterritoriali-\n\nzation (and thus on differential relations) that simultaneously define com-\n\nplementary, sedentary reterritorializations. Every stratum operates this\n\nway: by grasping in its pincers a maximum number of intensities or inten-\n\nsive particles over which it spreads its forms and substances, constituting\n\ndeterminate gradients and thresholds of resonance (deterritorialization on\n\na stratum always occurs in relation to a complementary reterrito-\n\nrialization).\n\n17\n\nAs long as preestablished forms were compared to predetermined\n\ndegrees, all one could do was affirm their irreducibility, and there was no\n\nway of judging possible communication between the two factors. But we\n\nsee now that forms depend on codes in the parastrata and plunge into pro-\n\ncesses of decoding or drift and that degrees themselves are caught up in\n\nmovements of intensive territorialization and reterritorialization. There is\n\nno simple correspondence between codes and territorialities on the one\n\nhand and decodings and deterritorialization on the other: on the contrary,\n\na code may be a deterritorialization and a reterritorialization a decoding.\n\nWide gaps separate code and territoriality. The two factors nevertheless\n\nhave the same \"subject\" in a stratum: it is populations that are deter-\n\nritorialized and reterritorialized, and also coded and decoded. In addition,\n\nthese factors communicate or interlace in the milieus.\n\nOn the one hand, modifications of a code have an aleatory cause in the\n\nmilieu of exteriority, and it is their effects on the interior milieus, their\n\ncompatibility with them, that decide whether they will be popularized.\n\nDeterritorializations and reterritorializations do not bring about the mod-\n\nifications; they do, however, strictly determine their selection. On the other\n\nhand, every modification has an associated milieu that in turn entails a\n\ncertain deterritorialization in relation to the milieu of exteriority and a\ncer-\n\ntain reterritorialization on intermediate or interior milieus.

This is especially true of an\nani-\n\nmal world, which is constituted, marked off by signs that divide it into\n\nzones (of shelter, hunting, neutrality, etc.), mobilize special organs, and\n\ncorrespond to fragments of code; this is so even at the margin of decoding\n\ninherent in the code. Even the domain of learning is defined by the code, or\n\nprescribed by it. But indexes or territorial signs are inseparable from a dou-\n\nble movement. Since the associated milieu always confronts a milieu of\n\nexteriority with which the animal is engaged and in which it takes neces-\n\nsary risks, a _line of flight _must be preserved to enable the animal to\nregain\n\nits associated milieu when danger appears (for example, the bull's line of\n\nflight in the arena, which it uses to regain the turf it has chosen).\n\n18\n\nA second\n\nkind of line of flight arises when the associated milieu is rocked by blows\n\nfrom the exterior, forcing the animal to abandon it and strike up an associa-\n\ntion with new portions of exteriority, this time leaning on its interior\n\nmilieus like fragile crutches. When the seas dried, the primitive Fish left\nits\n\nassociated milieu to explore land, forced to \"stand on its own legs,\" now\n\ncarrying water only on the inside, in the amniotic membranes protecting\n\nthe embryo. In one way or the other, the animal is more a fleer than a\n\nfighter, but its flights are also conquests, creations. Territorialities,\nthen,\n\nare shot through with lines of flight testifying to the presence within them\n\nof movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization. In a certain\n\nsense, they are secondary. They would be nothing without these move-\n\nments that deposit them. In short, the epistrata and parastrata are continu-\n\nally moving, sliding, shifting, and changing on the Ecumenon or unity of\n\ncomposition of a stratum; some are swept away by lines of flight and move-\n\nments of deterritorialization, others by processes of decoding or drift, but\n\nthey all communicate at the intersection of the milieus. The strata are con-\n\ntinually being shaken by phenomena of cracking and rupture, either at the\n\nlevel of the substrata that furnish the materials (a prebiotic soup, a\n\nprechemical soup ...), at the level of the accumulating epistrata, or at the\n\nlevel of the abutting parastrata: everywhere there arise simultaneous accel-\n\nerations and blockages, comparative speeds, differences in deterrito-\n\nrialization creating relative fields of reterritorialization.\n\nThese relative movements should most assuredly not be confused with\n\nthe possibility of absolute deterritorialization, an absolute line of flight,\n\nabsolute drift. The former are stratic or interstratic, whereas the latter\ncon-\n\ncern the plane of consistency and its destratification (its \"combustion,\" as\n\nGeoffroy would say). There is no doubt that mad physical particles crash\n\nthrough the strata as they accelerate, leaving minimal trace of their pas-\n\nsage, escaping spatiotemporal and even existential coordinates as they\n\ntend toward a state of absolute deterritorialization, the state of unformed\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)077.png)\n\n5\n\n6 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nmatter on the plane of consistency. In a certain sense, the acceleration of\n\nrelative deterritorializations reaches the sound barrier: if the particles\n\nbounce off this wall, or allow themselves to be captured by black holes, they\n\nfall back onto the strata, into the strata's relations and milieus; but if\nthey\n\ncross the barrier they reach the unformed, destratified element of the plane\n\nof consistency. _We may even say the the abstract machines that emit and  \ncombine particles have two very different modes of existence: the Ecumenon  \nand the Planomenon. _Either the abstract machines remain prisoner to\n\nstratifications, are enveloped in a certain specific stratum whose program\n\nor unity of composition they define (the abstract Animal, the abstract\n\nchemical Body, Energy in itself) and whose movements of relative\n\ndeterritorialization they regulate, Or, on the contrary, the abstract machine\n\ncuts across all stratifications, develops alone and in its own right on the\n\nplane of consistency whose diagram it constitutes, the same machine at\n\nwork in astrophysics and in microphysics, in the natural and in the artifi-\n\ncial, piloting flows of absolute deterritorialization (in no sense, of course,\nis\n\nunformed matter chaos of any kind). But this presentation is still too\n\nsimplified.\n\nFirst, one does not go from the relative to the absolute simply by acceler-\n\nation, even though increases in speed tend to have this comparative and\n\nglobal result. Absolute deterritorialization is not defined as a giant\nacceler-\n\nator; its absoluteness does not hinge on how fast it goes. It is actually\npossi-\n\nble to reach the absolute by way of phenomena of relative slowness or delay.\n\nRetarded development is an example. What qualifies a deterritorialization\n\nis not its speed (some are very slow) but its nature, whether it constitutes\n\nepistrata and parastrata and proceeds by articulated segments or, on the\n\ncontrary, jumps from one singularity to another following a\n\nnondecom-posable, nonsegmentary line drawing a metastratum of the plane\n\nof consistency. Second, under no circumstances must it be thought that\n\nabsolute deterritorialization comes suddenly of afterward, is in excess or\n\nbeyond. That would preclude any understanding of why the strata\n\nthemselves are animated by movements of relative deterritorialization and\n\ndecoding that are not like accidents occurring on them. In fact, what is\n\nprimary is an absolute deterritorialization an absolute line of flight,\n\nhowever complex or multiple\u2014that of the plane of consistency or body\n\nwithout organs (the Earth, the absolutely deterritorialized). This absolute\n\ndeterritorialization becomes relative only after stratification occurs on\n\nthat plane or body: It is the strata that are always residue, not the\n\nopposite. The question is not how something manages to leave the strata\n\nby how things get into them in the first place. There is a perpetual\n\nimmanence of absolute deterritorialization within relative\n\ndeterritorialization; and the machinic assemblages between strata that\n\nregulate the differential relations and relative\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)078.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 57\n\nmovements also have cutting edges of deterritorialization oriented toward\n\nthe absolute. The plane of consistency is always immanent to the strata; the\n\ntwo states of the abstract machine always coexist as two different states of\n\nintensities.\n\nMost of the audience had left (the first to go were the Marinetians with\n\ntheir double articulation, followed by the Hjelmslevians with their content\n\nand expression, and the biologists with their proteins and nucleic acids).\n\nThe only ones left were the mathematicians, accustomed to other follies,\n\nalong with a few astrologers, archaeologists, and scattered individuals.\n\nChallenger, moreover, had changed since the beginning of his talk. His\n\nvoice had become hoarser, broken occasionally by an apish cough. His\n\ndream was not so much to give a lecture to humans as to provide a program\n\nfor pure computers. Or else he was dreaming of an axiomatic, for\n\naxi-omatics deals essentially with stratification. Challenger was\n\naddressing himself to memory only. Now that we had discussed what was\n\nconstant and what varied in a stratum from the standpoint of substances\n\nand forms, the question remaining to be answered was what varied\n\nbetween strata from the standpoint of content and expression. For if it is\n\ntrue that there is always a real distinction constitutive of double\n\narticulation, a reciprocal presupposition of content and expression, then\n\nwhat varies from one stratum to another is the nature of this real\n\ndistinction, and the nature and respective positions of the terms\n\ndistinguished. Let us start with a certain group of strata that can be\n\ncharacterized summarily as follows: on these strata, content (form and\n\nsubstance) is molecular, and expression (form and substance) is molar.\n\nThe difference between the two is primarily one of order of magnitude or\n\nscale. Resonance, or the communication occurring between the two\n\nindependent orders, is what institutes the stratified system. The molecular\n\ncontent of that system has its own form corresponding to the distribution\n\nof elemental masses and the action of one molecule upon another;\n\nsimilarly, expression has a form manifesting the statistical aggregate and\n\nstate of equilibrium existing on the macroscopic level. Expression is like\n\nan \"operation of amplifying structuration carrying the active properties of\n\nthe originally microphysical discontinuity to the macrophysical level.\"\n\nWe took as our point of departure cases of this kind on the geological\n\nstratum, the crystalline stratum, and physicochemical strata, wherever the\n\nmolar can be said to express microscopic molecular interactions (\"the crys-\n\ntal is the macroscopic expression of a microscopic structure\"; the \"crystal-\n\nline form expresses certain atomic or molecular characteristics of the\n\nconstituent chemical categories\"). Of course, this still leaves numerous\n\npossibilities, depending on the number and nature of the intermediate\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)079.png)\n\n5\n\n8 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nstates, and also on the impact of exterior forces on the formation of expres-\n\nsion. There may be a greater or lesser number of intermediate states\n\nbetween the molecular and the molar; there may be a greater or lesser num-\n\nber of exterior forces or organizing centers participating in the molar form.\n\nDoubtless, these two factors are in an inverse relation to each other and\n\nindicate limit-cases. For example, the molar form of expression may be of\n\nthe \"mold\" type, mobilizing a maximum of exterior forces; or it may be of\n\nthe \"modulation\" type, bringing into play only a minimum number of\n\nthem. Even in the case of the mold, however, there are nearly instantane-\n\nous, interior intermediate states between the molecular content that\n\nassumes its own specific forms and the determinate molar expression of\n\nthe outside by the form of the mold. Conversely, even when the multiplica-\n\ntion and temporalization of the intermediate states testify to the endo-\n\ngenous character of the molar form (as with crystals), a minimum of\n\nexterior forces still intervene in each of the stages.\n\n19\n\nWe must therefore say\n\nthat the relative independence of content and expression, the real distinc-\n\ntion between molecular content and molar expression with their respective\n\nforms, has a special status enjoying a certain amount of latitude between\n\nthe limit-cases.\n\nSince strata are judgments of God, one should not hesitate to apply all\n\nthe subtleties of medieval Scholasticism and theology. There is a real dis-\n\ntinction between content and expression because the corresponding forms\n\nare effectively distinct in the \"thing\" itself, and not only in the mind of\nthe\n\nobserver. But this real distinction is quite special; it is only _formal\n_since the\n\ntwo forms compose or shape a single thing, a single stratified subject. Vari-\n\nous examples of formal distinction can be cited: between scales or orders of\n\nmagnitude (as between a map and its model; or, in a different fashion,\n\nbetween the micro- and macrophysical levels, as in the parable of\n\nEddington's two offices); between the various states or formal reasons\n\nthrough which a thing passes; between the thing in one form, and as\n\naffected by a possibly exterior causality giving it a different form; and so\n\nforth. (There is a proliferation of distinct forms because, in addition to\n\ncontent and expression each having its own forms, intermediate states\n\nintroduce forms of expression proper to content and forms of content\n\nproper to expression.)\n\nAs diverse and real as formal distinctions are, on the organic stratum the\n\nvery nature of the distinction changes. As a result, the entire distribution\n\nbetween content and expression is different. The organic stratum never-\n\ntheless preserves, and even amplifies, the relation between the molecular\n\nand the molar, with all kinds of intermediate states. We saw this in the case\n\nof morphogenesis, where double articulation is inseparable from a com-\n\nmunication between two orders of magnitude. The same thing applies to\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)080.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS D 59\n\ncellular chemistry. But the organic stratum has a unique character that\n\nmust account for the amplifications. In a preceding discussion, expression\n\nwas dependent upon the expressed molecular content in all directions and\n\nin every dimension and had independence only to the extent that it\n\nappealed to a higher order of magnitude and to exterior forces: The real dis-\n\ntinction was between forms, but forms belonging to the same aggregate, the\n\nsame thing or subject. _Now, however, expression becomes independent in its  \nown right, in other words, autonomous. _Before, the coding of a stratum was\n\ncoextensive with that stratum; on the organic stratum, on the other hand, it\n\ntakes place on an autonomous and independent line that detaches as much\n\nas possible from the second and third dimensions. Expression ceases to be\n\nvoluminous or superficial, becoming linear, unidimensional (even in its\n\nsegmentarity). The essential thing is _the linearity of the nucleic sequence._\n\n_20 _\n\nThe real distinction between content and expression, therefore, is not sim-\n\nply formal. It is strictly speaking real, and passes into the molecular, with-\n\nout regard to order of magnitude. It is between two classes of molecules,\n\nnucleic acids of expression and proteins of content, nucleic elements or\n\nnucleotides and protein elements or amino acids. Both expression and\n\ncontent are now molecular _and _molar. The distinction no longer concerns a\n\nsingle aggregate or subject; linearity takes us further in the direction of\nflat\n\nmultiplicities, rather than unity. Expression involves nucleotides and\n\nnucleic acids as well as molecules that, in their substance and form, are\n\nentirely independent not only of molecules of content but of any directed\n\naction in the exterior milieu. Thus invariance is a characteristic of certain\n\nmolecules and is not found exclusively on the molar scale. Conversely, pro-\n\nteins, in their substance and form of content, are equally independent of\n\nnucleotides: the only thing univocally determined is that one amino acid\n\nrather than another corresponds to a sequence of three nucleotides.\n\n2\n\n' What\n\nthe linear form of expression determines is therefore a derivative form of\n\nexpression, one that is relative to content and that, through a folding back\n\nupon itself of the protein sequence of the amino acids, finally yields the\n\ncharacteristic three-dimensional structures. In short, what is specific to the\n\norganic stratum is _this alignment of expression, this exhaustion or detach-  \nment of a line of expression, _this reduction of form and substance of expres-\n\nsion to a unidimensional line, guaranteeing their reciprocal independence\n\nfrom content without having to account for orders of magnitude.\n\nThis has many consequences. The new configuration of expression and\n\ncontent conditions not only the organism's power to reproduce but also its\n\npower to deterritorialize or accelerate deterritorialization. The alignment\n\nof the code or linearity of the nucleic sequence in fact marks a threshold of\n\ndeterritorialization of the \"sign\" that gives it a new ability to be copied\nand\n\nmakes the organism more deterritorialized than a crystal: only something\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)081.png)\n\n60 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\ndeterritorialized is capable of reproducing itself. When content and\n\nexpression are divided along the lines of the molecular and the molar, sub-\n\nstances move from state to state, from the preceding state to the following\n\nstate, or from layer to layer, from an already constituted layer to a layer in\n\nthe process of forming, while forms install themselves at the limit between\n\nthe last layer or last state and the exterior milieu. Thus the stratum devel-\n\nops into epistrata and parastrata; this is accomplished through a set of  \n_inductions _from layer to layer and state to state, or at the limit. A\ncrystal dis-\n\nplays this process in its pure state, since its form expands in all\ndirections,\n\nbut always as a function of the surface layer of the substance, which can be\n\nemptied of most of its interior without interfering with the growth. It is the\n\ncrystal's subjugation to three-dimensionality, in other words its index of\n\nterritoriality, that makes the structure incapable of formally reproducing\n\nand expressing itself; only the accessible surface can reproduce itself, since\n\nit is the only deterritorializable part. On the contrary, the detachment of a\n\npure line of expression on the organic stratum makes it possible for the\n\norganism to attain a much higher threshold of deterritorialization, gives it\n\na mechanism of reproduction covering all the details of its complex spatial\n\nstructure, and enables it to put all of its interior layers \"topologically in\n\ncontact\" with the exterior, or rather with the polarized limit (hence the spe-\n\ncial role of the living membrane). The development of the stratum into\n\nepistrata and parastrata occurs not through simple inductions but through  \n_transductions _that account for the amplification of the resonance between\n\nthe molecular and the molar, independently of order of magnitude; for the\n\nfunctional efficacy of the interior substances, independently of distance;\n\nand for the possibility of a proliferation and even interlacing of forms,\n\nindependently of codes (surplus values of code or phenomena of trans-\n\ncoding or aparallel evolution).\n\n22\n\nThere is a third major grouping of strata, defined less by a human\n\nessence than, once again, by a new distribution of content and expression.\n\nForm of content becomes \"alloplastic\" rather than \"homoplastic\"; in other\n\nwords, it brings about modifications in the external world. Form of expres-\n\nsion becomes linguistic rather than genetic; in other words, it operates with\n\nsymbols that are comprehensible, transmittable, and modifiable from out-\n\nside. What some call the properties of human beings\u2014technology and\n\nlanguage, tool and symbol, free hand and supple larynx, \"gesture and\n\nspeech\"\u2014are in fact properties of this new distribution. It would be diffi-\n\ncult to maintain that the emergence of human beings marked the absolute\n\norigin of this distribution. Leroi-Gourhan's analyses give us an under-\n\nstanding of how contents came to be linked with the hand-tool couple and\n\nexpressions with the face-language couple.\n\n23\n\nIn this context, the hand must\n\nnot be thought of simply as an organ but instead as a coding (the digital\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)082.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 61\n\ncode), a dynamic structuration, a dynamic formation (the manual form, or\n\nmanual formal traits). The hand as a general form of content is extended in\n\ntools, which are themselves active forms implying substances, or formed\n\nmatters; finally, products are formed matters, or substances, which in turn\n\nserve as tools. Whereas manual formal traits constitute the unity of compo-\n\nsition of the stratum, the forms and substances of tools and products are\n\norganized into parastrata and epistrata that themselves function as verita-\n\nble strata and mark discontinuities, breakages, communications and diffu-\n\nsions, nomadisms and sedentarities, multiple thresholds and speeds of\n\nrelative deterritorialization in human populations. For with the hand as a\n\nformal trait or general form of content a major threshold of deterri-\n\ntorialization is reached and opens, an accelerator that in itself permits a\n\nshifting interplay of comparative deterritorializations and\n\nreterritorial-izations\u2014what makes this acceleration possible is, precisely,\n\nphenomena of \"retarded development\" in the organic substrata. Not only is\n\nthe hand a deterritorialized front paw; the hand thus freed is itself\n\ndeterritorialized in relation to the grasping and locomotive hand of the\n\nmonkey. The synergistic deterritorializations of other organs (for\n\nexample, the foot) must be taken into account. So must correlative\n\ndeterritorializations of the milieu: the steppe as an associated milieu more\n\ndeterritorialized than the forest, exerting a selective pressure of\n\ndeterritorialization upon the body and technology (it was on the steppe, not\n\nin the forest, that the hand was able to appear as a free form, and fire as a\n\ntechnologically formable matter). Finally, complementary\n\nreterritorializations must be taken into account (the foot as a\n\ncompensatory reterritorialization for the hand, also occurring on the\n\nsteppe). Maps should be made of these things, organic, ecological, and\n\ntechnological maps one can lay out on the plane of consistency.\n\nOn the other hand, language becomes the new form of expression, or\n\nrather the set of formal traits defining the new expression in operation\n\nthroughout the stratum. Just as manual traits exist only in forms and\n\nformed matters that shatter their continuity and determine the distribution\n\nof their effects, formal traits of expression exist only in a diversity of\n\nformal languages and imply one or several formable substances. The sub-\n\nstance involved is fundamentally vocal substance, which brings into play\n\nvarious organic elements: not only the larynx, but the mouth and lips, and\n\nthe overall motricity of the face. Once again, a whole intensive map must\n\nbe accounted for: the mouth as a deterritorialization of the snout (the\n\nwhole \"conflict between the mouth and the brain,\" as Perrier called it); the\n\nlips as a deterritorialization of the mouth (only humans have lips, in other\n\nwords, an outward curling of the interior mucous membranes; only human\n\nfemales have breasts, in other words, deterritorialized mammary glands:\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)083.png)\n\n6\n\n2 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nthe extended nursing period advantageous for language learning is accom-\n\npanied by a complementary reterritorialization of the lips on the breasts,\n\nand the breasts on the lips). What a curious deterritorialization, filling\n\none's mouth with words instead of food and noises. The steppe, once more,\n\nseems to have exerted strong pressures of selection: the \"supple larynx\" is a\n\ndevelopment corresponding to the free hand and could have arisen only in\n\na deforested milieu where it is no longer necessary to have gigantic laryn-\n\ngeal sacks in order for one's cries to be heard above the constant din of the\n\nforest. To articulate, to speak, is to speak softly. Everyone knows that lum-\n\nberjacks rarely talk.\n\n24\n\nPhysiological, acoustic, and vocal substance are not\n\nthe only things that undergo all these deterritorializations. The form of\n\nexpression, as language, also crosses a threshold.\n\n_Vocal signs have temporal linearity, and it is this superlinearity _that con-\n\nstitutes their specific deterritorialization and differentiates them from\n\ngenetic linearity. Genetic linearity is above all spatial, even though its\nseg-\n\nments are constructed and reproduced in succession; thus at this level it\n\ndoes not require effective overcoding of any kind, only phenomena of\n\nend-to-end connection, local regulations, and partial interactions\n\n(overcoding takes place only at the level of integrations implying\n\ndifferent orders of magnitude). That is why Jacob is reluctant to compare\n\nthe genetic code to a language; in fact, the genetic code has neither\n\nemitter, receiver, comprehension, nor translation, only redundancies and\n\nsurplus values.\n\n25\n\nThe temporal linearity of language expression relates not\n\nonly to a succession but to a formal synthesis of succession in which time\n\nconstitutes a process of linear overcoding and engenders a phenomenon\n\nunknown on the other strata: _translation, _translatability, as opposed to the\n\nprevious inductions and transductions. Translation should not be\n\nunderstood simply as the ability of one language to \"represent\" in some\n\nway the givens of another language, but beyond that as the ability of\n\nlanguage, with its own givens on its own stratum, to represent all the\n\nother strata and thus achieve a scientific conception of the world. The\n\nscientific world _{Welt, _as opposed to the _Umwelt _of the animal) is the\n\ntranslation of all of the flows, particles, codes, and territorialities of the\n\nother strata into a sufficiently deterritorialized system of signs, in other\n\nwords, into an overcoding specific to language. This property of  \n_overcoding _or _superlinearity _explains why, in language, not only is\n\nexpression independent of content, but form of expression is independent\n\nof substance: translation is possible because the same form can pass from\n\none substance to another, which is not the case for the genetic code, for\n\nexample, between RNA and DNA chains. We will see later on how this situ-\n\nation gives rise to certain imperialist pretentions on behalf of language,\n\nwhich are naively expressed in such formulas as: \"Every semiology of a\n\nnonlinguistic system must use the medium of language... .Language is the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)084.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS D 63\n\ninterpreter of all the other systems, linguistic and nonlinguistic.\" This\n\namounts to defining an abstract character of language and then saying that\n\nthe other strata can share in that character only by being spoken in lan-\n\nguage. That is stating the obvious. More positively, it must be noted that\n\nthe immanence within language of universal translation means that its\n\nepistrata and parastrata, with respect to superpositions, diffusions, com-\n\nmunications, and abutments, operate in an entirely different manner than\n\nthose of other strata: all human movements, even the most violent, imply\n\ntranslations.\n\nWe have to hurry, Challenger said, we're being rushed by the line of time\n\non this third stratum. So we have a new organization of content and\n\nexpression, each with its own forms and substances: technological content,\n\nsemiotic or symbolic expression. Content should be understood not sim-\n\nply as the hand and tools but as a technical social machine that preexists\n\nthem and constitutes states of force or formations of power. Expression\n\nshould be understood not simply as the face and language, or individual\n\nlanguages, but as a semiotic collective machine that preexists them and\n\nconstitutes regimes of signs. A formation of power is much more than a\n\ntool; a regime of signs is much more than a language. Rather, they act as\n\ndetermining and selective agents, as much in the constitution of languages\n\nand tools as in their usages and mutual or respective diffusions and com-\n\nmunications. The third stratum sees the emergence of Machines that are\n\nfully a part of that stratum but at the same time rear up and stretch their\n\npincers out in all directions at all the other strata. _Is this not like an\ninterme-  \ndiate state between the two states of the abstract Machine?_\u2014the state in\n\nwhich it remains enveloped in a corresponding stratum (ecumenon), and\n\nthe state in which it develops in its own right on the destratified plane of\n\nconsistency (planomenon). The abstract machine begins to unfold, to\n\nstand to full height, producing an illusion exceeding all strata, even though\n\nthe machine itself still belongs to a determinate stratum. This is, obviously,\n\nthe illusion constitutive of man (who does man think he is?). This illusion\n\nderives from the overcoding immanent to language itself. But what is not\n\nillusory are the new distributions between content and expression: techno-\n\nlogical content characterized by the hand-tool relation and, at a deeper\n\nlevel, tied to a social Machine and formations of power; symbolic expres-\n\nsion characterized by face-language relations and, at a deeper level, tied to\n\na semiotic Machine and regimes of signs. On both sides, the epistrata and\n\nparastrata, the superposed degrees and abutting forms, attain more than\n\never before the status of autonomous strata in their own right. In cases\n\nwhere we can discern two different regimes of signs or two different forma-\n\ntions of power, we shall say that they are in fact two different strata in\n\nhuman populations.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)085.png)\n\n64 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nWhat precisely is the relation now between content and expression, and\n\nwhat type of distinction is there between them? It's all in the head. Yet\n\nnever was a distinction more real. What we are trying to say is that there is\n\nindeed one exterior milieu for the entire stratum, permeating the entire\n\nstratum: the cerebral-nervous milieu. It comes from the organic substra-\n\ntum, but of course that substratum does not merely play the role of a sub-\n\nstratum or passive support. It is no less complex in organization. Rather, it\n\nconstitutes the prehuman soup immersing us. Our hands and faces are\n\nimmersed in it. The brain is a population, a set of tribes tending toward two\n\npoles. In Leroi-Gourhan's analyses of the constitution of these two poles in\n\nthe soup\u2014one of which depends on the actions of the face, the other on the\n\nhand\u2014their correlation or relativity does not preclude a real distinction\n\nbetween them; quite the contrary, it entails one, as the reciprocal presuppo-\n\nsition of two articulations, the manual articulation of content and the\n\nfacial articulation of expression. And the distinction is not simply real, as\n\nbetween molecules, things, or subjects; it has become _essential _(as they\n\nused to say in the Middle Ages), as between attributes, genres of being, or\n\nirreducible categories: things and words. Yet we find that the most general\n\nof movements, the one by which each of the distinct articulations is already\n\ndouble in its own right, carries over onto this level; certain formal elements\n\nof content play the role of expression in relation to content proper, and cer-\n\ntain formal elements of expression play the role of content in relation to\n\nexpression proper. In the first case, Leroi-Gourhan shows how the hand\n\ncreates a whole world of symbols, a whole pluridimensional language, not\n\nto be confused with unilinear verbal language, which constitutes a radiat-\n\ning expression specific to content (he sees this as the origin of writing).\n\n26\n\nThe second case is clearly displayed in the double articulation specific to\n\nlanguage itself, since phonemes form a radiating content specific to the\n\nexpression of monemes as linear significant segments (it is only under\n\nthese conditions that double articulation as a general characteristic of\n\nstrata has the linguistic meaning Martinet attributes to it). Our discussion\n\nof the relations between content and expression, the real distinction\n\nbetween them, and the variations of those relations and that distinction on\n\nthe major types of strata, is now provisionally complete.\n\nChallenger wanted to go faster and faster.

We may summarily distinguish three\n\nkinds of signs: _indexes (territorial signs), symbols (deterritorialized\nsigns),  \nand icons (signs of reterritorialization). _Should we say that there are signs\n\non all the strata, under the pretext that every stratum includes territoriali-\n\nties and movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization? This\n\nkind of expansive method is very dangerous, because it lays the ground-\n\nwork for or reinforces the imperialism of language, if only by relying on its\n\nfunction as universal translator or interpreter. It is obvious that there is\nno\n\nsystem of signs common to all strata, not even in the form of a semiotic\n\n\"chora\" theoretically prior to symbolization.\n\n27\n\nIt would appear that we\n\nmay accurately speak of signs only when there is a distinction between\n\nforms of expression and forms of content that is not only real but also cate-\n\ngorical. Under these conditions, there is a semiotic system on the corre-\n\nsponding stratum because the abstract machine has precisely that fully\n\nerect posture that permits it to \"write,\" in other words, to treat language\n\nand extract a _regime _of signs from it. But before it reaches that point, in\n\nso-called natural codings, the abstract machine remains enveloped in the\n\nstrata: It does not write in any way and has no margin of latitude allowing it\n\nto recognize something as a sign (except in the strictly territorial sense of\n\nanimal signs). After that point, the abstract machine develops on the plane\n\nof consistency and no longer has any way of making a categorical distinc-\n\ntion between signs and particles; for example, it writes, but flush with the\n\nreal, it inscribes directly upon the plane of consistency. It therefore seems\n\nreasonable to reserve the word \"sign\" in the strict sense for the last group\nof\n\nstrata. This terminological discussion would be entirely without interest if\n\nit did not bring us to yet another danger: not the imperialism of language\n\naffecting all of the strata, but the imperialism of the signifier affecting\nlan-\n\nguage itself, affecting all regimes of signs and the entire expanse of the\n\nstrata upon which they are located. The question here is not whether there\n\nare signs on every stratum but whether all signs are signifiers, whether all\n\nsigns are endowed with signifiance, whether the semiotic of signs is neces-\n\nsarily linked to a semiology of the signifier. Those who take this route may\n\neven be led to forgo the notion of the sign, for the primacy of the signifier\n\nover language guarantees the primacy of language over all of the strata even\n\nmore effectively than the simple expansion of the sign in all directions.\n\nWhat we are saying is that the illusion specific to _this _posture of the\nabstract\n\nMachine, the illusion that one can grasp and shuffle all the strata between\n\none's pincers, can be better secured through the erection of the signifier\n\nthan through the extension of the sign (thanks to signifiance, language can\n\nclaim to be in direct contact with the strata without having to go through\n\nthe supposed signs on each one). But we're still going in the same circle,\n\nwe're still spreading the same canker.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)087.png)\n\n6\n\n6 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nThe linguistic relation between the signifier and signified has, of course,\n\nbeen conceived in many different ways. It has been said that they are\n\narbitrary; that they are as necessary to each other as the two sides of the\n\nsame leaf; that they correspond term by term, or else globally; and that they\n\nare so ambivalent as to be indistinguishable. In any event, the signified is\n\nthought not to exist outside of its relationship with signifier, and the ulti-\n\nmate signified is the very existence of the signifier, extrapolated beyond the\n\nsign. There is only one thing that can be said about the signifier: it is\nRedun-\n\ndancy, it is the Redundant. Hence its incredible despotism, and its success.\n\nTheories of arbitrariness, necessity, term-by-term or global correspon-\n\ndence, and ambivalence serve the same cause: the reduction of expression\n\nto the signifier. Yet forms of content and forms of expression are highly\n\nrelative, always in a state of reciprocal presupposition. The relations\n\nbetween their respective segments are biunivocal, exterior, and \"de-\n\nformed.\" There is never conformity between the two, or from one to the\n\nother. There is always real independence and a real distinction; even to fit\n\nthe forms together, and to determine the relations between them, requires a\n\nspecific, variable assemblage. None of these characteristics applies to the\n\nsignifier-signified relation, even though some seem to coincide with it par-\n\ntially and accidentally. Overall, these characteristics stand in radical oppo-\n\nsition to the scenario of the signifier. A form of content is not a signified,\n\nany more than a form of expression is a signifier.\n\n28\n\nThis is true for all the\n\nstrata, including those on which language plays a role.\n\nSignifier enthusiasts take an oversimplified situation as their implicit\n\nmodel: word and thing. From the word they extract the signifier, and from\n\nthe thing a signified in conformity with the word, and therefore subjugated\n\nto the signifier. They operate in a sphere interior to and homogeneous with\n\nlanguage. Let us follow Foucault in his exemplary analysis, which, though\n\nit seems not to be, is eminently concerned with linguistics. Take a thing like\n\nthe prison: the prison is a form, the \"prison-form\"; it is a form of content\non\n\na stratum and is related to other forms of content (school, barracks, hospi-\n\ntal, factory). This thing or form does not refer back to the word \"prison\"\n\nbut to entirely different words and concepts, such as \"delinquent\" and\n\n\"delinquency,\" which express a new way of classifying, stating, translating,\n\nand even committing criminal acts. \"Delinquency\" is the form of expres-\n\nsion in reciprocal presupposition with the form of content \"prison.\" Delin-\n\nquency is in no way a signifier, even a juridical signifier, the signified of\n\nwhich would be the prison. That would flatten the entire analysis. More-\n\nover, the form of expression is reducible not to words but to a set of state-\n\nments arising in the social field considered as a stratum (that is what a\n\nregime of signs is). The form of content is reducible not to a thing but to a\n\ncomplex state of things as a formation of power (architecture, regimenta-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)088.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 67\n\ntion, etc.). We could say that there are two constantly intersecting multipli-\n\ncities, \"discursive multiplicities\" of expression and \"nondiscursive multi-\n\nplicities\" of content. It is even more complex than that because the prison\n\nas a form of content has a relative expression all its own; there are all\nkinds\n\nof statements specific to it that do not necessarily coincide with the state-\n\nments of delinquency. Conversely, delinquency as a form of expression has\n\nan autonomous content all its own, since delinquency expresses not only a\n\nnew way of evaluating crimes but a new way of committing them. Form of\n\ncontent and form of expression, prison and delinquency: each has its own\n\nhistory, microhistory, segments. At most, along with other contents and\n\nexpressions, they imply a shared state of the abstract Machine acting not at\n\nall as a signifier but as a kind of diagram (a single abstract machine for the\n\nprison and the school and the barracks and the hospital and the factory\n\n...). Fitting the two types of forms together, segments of content and\n\nsegments of expression, requires a whole double-pincered, or rather\n\ndouble-headed, concrete assemblage taking their real distinction into\n\naccount. It requires a whole organization articulating formations of power\n\nand regimes of signs, and operating on the molecular level (societies char-\n\nacterized by what Foucault calls disciplinary power).\n\n29\n\nIn short, we should\n\nnever oppose words to things that supposedly correspond to them, nor\n\nsignifiers to signifieds that are supposedly in conformity with them. What\n\nshould be opposed are distinct formalizations, in a state of unstable equi-\n\nlibrium or reciprocal presupposition. \"// _is in vain that we say what we see;  \nwhat we see never resides in what wesay.\"_\n\n_i0_\n\n_ _As in school: there is not just one\n\nwriting lesson, that of the great redundant Signifier for any and all\n\nsignifieds. There are two distinct formalizations in reciprocal presupposi-\n\ntion and constituting a double-pincer: the formalization of expression in\n\nthe reading and writing lesson (with its own relative contents), and the\n\nformalization of content in the lesson of things (with their own relative\n\nexpressions). We are never signifier or signified. We are stratified.\n\nThe preferred method would be severely restrictive, as opposed to the\n\nexpansive method that places signs on all strata or signifier in all signs\n\n(although at the limit it may forgo signs entirely). First, there exist forms\nof\n\nexpression without signs (for example, the genetic code has nothing to do\n\nwith a language). It is only under certain conditions that strata can be said\n\nto include signs; signs cannot be equated with language in general but are\n\ndefined by regimes of statements that are so many real usages or functions\n\nof language. Then why retain the word _sign _for these regimes, which forma-\n\nlize an expression without designating or signifying the simultaneous con-\n\ntents, which are formalized in a different way? Signs are not signs of a\nthing;\n\nthey are signs of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, they mark a\n\ncertain threshold crossed in the course of these movements, and it is for\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)089.png)\n\n6\n\n8 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nthis reason that the word should be retained (as we have seen, this applies\n\neven to animal \"signs\").\n\nNext, if we consider regimes of signs using this restrictive definition, we\n\nsee that they are not, or not necessarily, signifiers. Just as signs designate\n\nonly a certain formalization of expression in a determinate group of strata,\n\nsignifiance itself designates only one specific regime among a number of\n\nregimes existing in that particular formalization. Just as there are\n\nase-miotic expressions, or expressions without signs, there are\n\nasemiological regimes of signs, asignifying signs, both on the strata and\n\non the plane of consistency. The most that can be said of signifiance is that\n\nit characterizes _one _regime, which is not even the most interesting or\n\nmodern or contemporary one, but is perhaps only more pernicious,\n\ncancerous, and despotic than the others, and more steeped in illusion than\n\nthey.\n\nIn any case, content and expression are never reducible to\n\nsignified-signifier. And (this is the second problem) neither are they\n\nreducible to base-superstructure. One can no more posit a primacy of\n\ncontent as the determining factor than a primacy of expression as a\n\nsignifying system. Expression can never be made into a form reflecting\n\ncontent, even if one endows it with a \"certain\" amount of independence\n\nand a certain potential for reacting, if only because so-called economic\n\ncontent already has a form and even forms of expression that are specific\n\nto it. Form of content and form of expression involve two parallel\n\nformalizations in presupposition: it is obvious that their segments\n\nconstantly intertwine, embed themselves in one another; but this is\n\naccomplished by the abstract machine from which the two forms derive,\n\nand by machinic assemblages that regulate their relations. If this\n\nparallelism is replaced by a pyramidal image, then content (including its\n\nform) becomes an economic base of production displaying all of the\n\ncharacteristics of the Abstract; the assemblages become the first story of a\n\nsuperstructure that, as such, is necessarily situated within a State\n\napparatus; the regimes of signs and forms of expression become the\n\nsecond story of the superstructure, defined by ideology. It isn't altogether\n\nclear where language should go, since the great Despot decided that it\n\nshould be reserved a special place, as the common good of the nation and\n\nthe vehicle for information. Thus one misconstrues the nature of language,\n\nwhich exists only in heterogeneous regimes of signs, and rather than\n\ncirculating information distributes contradictory orders. It misconstrues\n\nthe nature of regimes of signs, which express organizations of power or\n\nassemblages and have nothing to do with ideology as the supposed expres-\n\nsion of a content (ideology is a most execrable concept obscuring all of the\n\neffectively operating social machines). It misconstrues the nature of orga-\n\nnizations of power, which are in no way located within a State apparatus\n\nbut rather are everywhere, effecting formalizations of content and expres-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)090.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 69\n\nsion, the segments of which they intertwine. Finally, it misconstrues the  \nnature of content, which is in no way economic \"in the last instance,\" since  \nthere are as many directly economic signs or expressions as there are  \nnoneconomic contents. Nor can the status of social formations be analyzed  \nby throwing some signifier into the base, or vice versa, or a bit of phallus\nor  \ncastration into political economy, or a bit of economics or politics into  \npsychoanalysis.\n\nThere is a third problem. It is difficult to elucidate the system of the\n\nstrata without seeming to introduce a kind of cosmic or even spiritual evo-  \nlution from one to the other, as if they were arranged in stages and ascended  \ndegrees of perfection. Nothing of the sort. The different figures of content  \nand expression are not stages. There is no biosphere or noosphere, but  \neverywhere the same Mechanosphere. If one begins by considering the  \nstrata in themselves, it cannot be said that one is less organized than  \nanother. This even applies to a stratum serving as a substratum: there is no  \nfixed order, and one stratum can serve directly as a substratum for another  \nwithout the intermediaries one would expect there to be from the stand-  \npoint of stages and degrees (for example, microphysical sectors can serve as  \nan immediate substratum for organic phenomena). Or the apparent order  \ncan be reversed, with cultural or technical phenomena providing a fertile  \nsoil, a good soup, for the development of insects, bacteria, germs, or even  \nparticles. The industrial age defined as the age of insects ... It's even\nworse  \nnowadays: you can't even tell in advance which stratum is going to commu-  \nnicate with which other, or in what direction. Above all, there is no lesser,  \nno higher or lower, organization; the substratum is an integral part of the  \nstratum, is bound up with it as the milieu in which change occurs, and not  \nan increase in organization.\n\n31\n\nFurthermore, if we consider the plane of con-\n\nsistency we note that the most disparate of things and signs move upon it: a  \nsemiotic fragment rubs shoulders with a chemical interaction, an electron  \ncrashes into a language, a black hole captures a genetic message, a crystalli-  \nzation produces a passion, the wasp and the orchid cross a letter... There  \nis no \"like\" here, we are not saying \"like an electron,\" \"like an\ninteraction,\"  \netc. The plane of consistency is the abolition of all metaphor; all that con-  \nsists is Real. These are electrons in person, veritable black holes, actual  \norganites, authentic sign sequences. It's just that they have been uprooted  \nfrom their strata, destratified, decoded, deterritorialized, and that is what  \nmakes their proximity and interpenetration in the plane of consistency  \npossible. A silent dance. _The plane of consistency knows nothing of differ-  \nences in level, orders of magnitude, or distances.

Not only does the abstract\n\nmachine have different simultaneous states accounting for the complex-\n\nity of what takes place on the plane of consistency, but the abstract\n\nmachine should not be confused with what we call a concrete machinic\n\nassemblage. The _abstract machine _sometimes develops upon the plane of\n\nconsistency, whose continuums, emissions, and conjugations it con-\n\nstructs, and sometimes remains enveloped in a stratum whose unity of\n\ncomposition and force of attraction or prehension it defines. The  \n_machinic assemblage _is something entirely different from the abstract\n\nmachine, even though it is very closely connected with it. First, on a stra-\n\ntum, it performs the coadaptations of content and expression, ensures\n\nbiunivocal relationships between segments of content and segments of\n\nexpression, and guides the division of the stratum into epistrata and\n\nparastrata. Next, between strata, it ensures the relation to whatever serves\n\nas a substratum and brings about the corresponding changes in\n\norganization. Finally, it is in touch with the plane of consistency because\n\nit necessarily effectuates the abstract machine on a particular stratum,\n\nbetween strata, and in the relation between the strata and the plane. An\n\nassemblage (for example, the smith's anvil among the Dogons) is neces-\n\nsary for the articulations of the organic stratum to come about. An assem-\n\nblage is necessary for the relation between two strata to come about. And\n\nan assemblage is necessary for organisms to be caught within and perme-\n\nated by a social field that utilizes them: Must not the Amazons amputate a\n\nbreast to adapt the organic stratum to a warlike technological stratum, as\n\nthough at the behest of a fearsome woman-bow-steppe assemblage?\n\nAssemblages are necessary for states offeree and regimes of signs to inter-\n\ntwine their relations. Assemblages are necessary in order for the unity of\n\ncomposition enveloped in a stratum, the relations between a given stra-\n\ntum and the others, and the relation between these strata and the plane of\n\nconsistency to be organized rather than random. In every respect,\n\nmachinic assemblages _effectuate _the abstract machine insofar as it is\n\ndeveloped on the plane of consistency or enveloped in a stratum. The\n\nmost important problem of all: given a certain machinic assemblage,\n\nwhat is its relation of effectuation with the abstract machine? How does it\n\neffectuate it, with what adequation? Classify assemblages. What we call\n\nthe mechanosphere is the set of all abstract machines and machinic\n\nassemblages outside the strata, on the strata, or between strata.\n\nThe system of the strata thus has nothing to do with signifier and signi-\n\nfied, base and superstructure, mind and matter. All of these are ways of\n\nreducing the strata to a single stratum, or of closing the system in on itself\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)093.png)\n\n7\n\n2 \u25a1 10,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS\n\nby cutting it off from the plane of consistency as destratification. We had to\n\nsummarize before we lost our voice. Challenger was finishing up. His voice\n\nhad become unbearably shrill. He was suffocating. His hands were becom-\n\ning elongated pincers that had become incapable of grasping anything but\n\ncould still vaguely point to things. Some kind of matter seemed to be pour-\n\ning out from the double mask, the two heads; it was impossible to tell\n\nwhether it was getting thicker or more watery. Some of the audience had\n\nreturned, but only shadows and prowlers. \"You hear that? It's an animal's\n\nvoice.\" So the summary would have to be quick, the terminology would\n\nhave to be set down as well as possible, for no good reason. There was a first\n\ngroup of notions: the Body without Organs or the destratified Plane of\n\nConsistency; the Matter of the Plane, that which occurs on the body or\n\nplane (singular, nonsegmented multiplicities composed of intensive con-\n\ntinuums, emissions of particles-signs, conjunctions of flows); and the\n\nabstract Machine, or abstract Machines, insofar as they construct that\n\nbody or draw that plane or \"diagram\" what occurs (lines of flight, or abso-\n\nlute deterritorializations).\n\nThen there was the system of the strata. On the intensive continuum, the\n\nstrata fashion forms and form matters into substances. In combined emis-\n\nsions, they make the distinction between expressions and contents, units of\n\nexpression and units of content, for example, signs and particles. In con-\n\njunctions, they separate flows, assigning them relative movements and\n\ndiverse territorialities, relative deterritorializations and complementary\n\nreterritorializations. Thus the strata set up everywhere double articula-\n\ntions animated by movements: forms and substances of content and forms\n\nand substances of expression constituting segmentary multiplicities with\n\nrelations that are determinable in every case. Such are the _strata. _Each\nstra-\n\ntum is a double articulation of content and expression, both of which are\n\nreally distinct and in a state of reciprocal presupposition. Content and\n\nexpression intermingle, and it is two-headed machinic assemblages that\n\nplace their segments in relation. What varies from stratum to stratum is the\n\nnature of the real distinction between content and expression, the nature of\n\nthe substances as formed matters, and the nature of the relative move-\n\nments. We may make a summary distinction between three major types of\n\nreal distinction: the real-formal distinction between orders of magnitude,\n\nwith the establishment of a resonance of expression (induction); the\n\nreal-real distinction between different subjects, with the establishment of\n\na linearity of expression (transduction); and the real-essential distinction\n\nbetween different attributes or categories, with the establishment of a\n\nsuperlinearity of expression (translation).\n\nEach stratum serves as the substratum for another stratum. Each stra-\n\ntum has a unity of composition defined by its milieu, substantial elements,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)094.png)\n\n1\n\n0,000 B.C.: THE GEOLOGY OF MORALS \u25a1 73\n\nand formal traits (Ecumenon). But it divides into _parastrata _according to\n\nits irreducible forms and associated milieus, and into _epistrata _according\n\nto its layers of formed substances and intermediary milieus. Epistrata and\n\nparastrata must themselves be thought of as strata. A machinic assemblage\n\nis an _interstratum _insofar as it regulates the relations between strata, as\nwell\n\nas the relations between contents and expressions on each stratum, in\n\nconformity with the preceding divisions. A single assemblage can borrow\n\nfrom different strata, and with a certain amount of apparent disorder;\n\nconversely, a stratum or element of a stratum can join others in function-\n\ning in a different assemblage. Finally, the machinic assemblage is a  \n_metastratum _because it is also in touch with the plane of consistency and\n\nnecessarily effectuates the abstract machine. The abstract machine exists\n\nenveloped in each stratum, whose Ecumenon or unity of composition it\n\ndefines, and developed on the plane of consistency, whose destratification\n\nit performs (the Planomenon). Thus when the assemblages fit together the\n\nvariables of a stratum as a function of its unity, they also bring about a\nspe-\n\ncific effectuation of the abstract machine as it exists outside the strata.\n\nMachinic assemblages are simultaneously located at the intersection of the\n\ncontents and expression on each stratum, and at the intersection of all of\n\nthe strata with the plane of consistency. They rotate in all directions, like\n\nbeacons.\n\nIt was over. Only later on would all of this take on concrete meaning.

The indifference to any kind of credibility exhib-\n\nited by these announcements often verges on provocation. This is proof\n\nthat the issue lies elsewhere. Let people say...: that is all language\n\ndemands. Spengler notes that the fundamental forms of speech are not the\n\nstatement of a judgment or the expression of a feeling, but \"the command,\n\nthe expression of obedience, the assertion, the question, the affirmation or\n\nnegation,\" very short phrases that command life and are inseparable from\n\nenterprises and large-scale projects: \"Ready?\" \"Yes.\" \"Go ahead.\"\n\n3\n\nWords\n\nare not tools, but we give children language, pens, and notebooks as we give\n\nworkers shovels and pickaxes. A rule of grammar is a power marker before\n\nit is a syntactical marker. The order does not refer to prior significations\nor\n\nto a prior organization of distinctive units. Quite the opposite. Informa-\n\ntion is only the strict minimum necessary for the emission, transmission,\n\nand observation of orders as commands. One must be just informed\n\nenough not to confuse \"Fire!\" with \"Fore!\" or to avoid the unfortunate situ-\n\nation of the teacher and the student as described by Lewis Carroll (the\n\nteacher, at the top of the stairs, asks a question that is passed on by\nservants,\n\nwho distort it at each step of the way, and the student, below in the court-\n\nyard, returns an answer that is also distorted at each stage of the trip\nback).\n\nLanguage is not life; it gives life orders.

If language\n\nalways seems to presuppose itself, if we cannot assign it a nonlinguistic\n\npoint of departure, it is because language does not operate between some-\n\nthing seen (or felt) and something said, but always goes from saying to say-\n\ning. We believe that narrative consists not in communicating what one has\n\nseen but in transmitting what one has heard, what someone else said to\n\nyou. Hearsay.

Metaphors and metonymies are merely effects; they are a part of\n\nlanguage only when they presuppose indirect discourse. There are many\n\npassions in a passion, all manner of voices in a voice, murmurings, speak-\n\ning in tongues: that is why all discourse is indirect, and the translative\n\nmovement proper to language is that of indirect discourse.\n\n5\n\nBenveniste\n\ndenies that the bee has language, even though it has an organic coding pro-\n\ncess and _even uses tropes. _It has no language because it can communicate\n\nwhat it has seen but not transmit what has been communicated to it.

It is in\n\nthis sense that language is the transmission of the word as order-word, not\n\nthe communication of a sign as information. Language is a map, not a trac-\n\ning. But how can the order-word be a function coextensive with language\n\nwhen the order, the command, seems tied to a restricted type of explicit\n\nproposition marked by the imperative?\n\nAustin's famous theses clearly demonstrate that the various extrinsic\n\nrelations between action and speech by which a statement can describe an\n\naction in an indicative mode or incite it in an imperative mode, etc., are not\n\nall there is. There are also intrinsic relations between speech and certain\n\nactions that are accomplished by _sayingthem _(the performative: I swear by\n\nsaying \"I swear\"), and more generally between speech and certain actions\n\nthat are accomplished in speaking (the illocutionary: I ask a question by\n\nsaying \"Is ... ?\" I make a promise by saying \"I love you ...\"; I give a com-\n\nmand by using the imperative, etc.). These acts internal to speech, these\n\nimmanent relations between statements and acts, have been termed  \n_implicit or nondiscursive presuppositions, _as opposed to the potentially\n\nexplicit assumptions by which a statement refers to other statements or an\n\nexternal action (Ducrot). The theory of the performative sphere, and the\n\nbroader sphere of the illocutionary, has had three important and immedi-\n\nate consequences: (1) It has made it impossible to conceive of language as a\n\ncode, since a code is the condition of possibility for all explanation. It has\n\nalso made it impossible to conceive of speech as the communication of\n\ninformation: to order, question, promise, or affirm is not to inform some-\n\none about a command, doubt, engagement, or assertion but to effectuate\n\nthese specific, immanent, and necessarily implicit acts. (2) It has made it\n\nimpossible to define semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics as scien-\n\ntific zones of language independent _of pragmatics. _Pragmatics ceases to be\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)099.png)\n\n7\n\n8 \u25a1 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\na \"trash heap,\" pragmatic determinations cease to be subject to the alterna-  \ntive: fall outside language, or answer to explicit conditions that\nsyntacticize  \nand semanticize pragmatic determinations. Instead, pragmatics becomes  \nthe presupposition behind all of the other dimensions and insinuates itself  \ninto everything. (3) It makes it impossible to maintain the distinction  \nbetween language and speech because speech can no longer be defined sim-  \nply as the extrinsic and individual use of a primary signification, or the\nvar-  \niable application of a preexisting syntax. Quite the opposite, the meaning  \nand syntax of language can no longer be defined independently of the  \nspeech acts they presuppose.\n\n7\n\nIt is true that it is still difficult to see how speech acts or implicit\npresup-\n\npositions can be considered a function coextensive with language. It is all  \nthe more difficult if one starts with the performative (that which one does  \nby saying it) and moves by extension to the illocutionary (that which one  \ndoes in speaking). For it is always possible to thwart that move. The  \nperformative can be walled in by explaining it by specific syntactic and  \nsemantic characteristics avoiding any recourse to a generalized prag-  \nmatics. According to Benveniste, for example, the performative relates not  \nto acts but instead to a property of_self-referentiality _of terms (the true\nper-  \nsonal pronouns, I, YOU..., defined as shifters). By this account, a  \npreexistent structure of subjectivity, or intersubjectivity, in language,  \nrather than presupposing speech acts, is adequate to account for them.\n\n8\n\nBenveniste thus defines language as communicational rather than infor-  \nmational; this properly linguistic intersubjectivity, or subjectification,  \nexplains all the rest, in other words, everything that is brought into being\nby  \nsaying it. The question is whether subjective communication is any better a  \nlinguistic notion than ideal information. Oswald Ducrot has set forth the  \nreasons that have led him to reverse Benveniste's schema: The phenome-  \nnon of self-referentiality cannot account for the performative. The oppo-  \nsite is the case; it is \"the fact that certain statements are socially devoted\nto  \nthe accomplishment of certain actions\" that explains self-referentiality.  \nThe performative itself is explained by the illocutionary, not the opposite.  \nIt is the illocutionary that constitutes the nondiscursive or implicit presup-  \npositions. And the illocutionary is in turn explained by collective assem-  \nblages of enunciation, by juridical acts or equivalents of juridical acts,  \nwhich, far from depending on subjectification proceedings or assignations  \nof subjects in language, in fact determine their distribution. Communica-  \ntion is no better a concept than information; intersubjectivity gets us no  \nfurther than signifiance in accounting for these \"statements-acts\" assem-  \nblages that in each language delimit the role and range of subjective mor-  \nphemes.\n\n9\n\n(We will see that the analysis of indirect discourse confirms this\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)100.png)\n\nN\n\nOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS \u25a1 79\n\npoint of view since it shows that subjectifications are not primary but\n\nresult from a complex assemblage.)\n\nWe call _order-words, _not a particular category of explicit statements (for\n\nexample, in the imperative), but the relation of every word or every state-\n\nment to implicit presuppositions, in other words, to speech acts that are,\n\nand can only be, accomplished in the statement. Order-words do not con-\n\ncern commands only, but every act that is linked to statements by a \"social\n\nobligation.\" Every statement displays this link, directly or indirectly. Ques-\n\ntions, promises, are order-words. The only possible definition of language\n\nis the set of all order-words, implicit presuppositions, or speech acts cur-\n\nrent in a language at a given moment.\n\nThe relation between the statement and the act is internal, immanent,\n\nbut it is not one of identity. Rather, it is a relation _of redundancy. _The\n\norder-word itself is the redundancy of the act and the statement.\n\nNewspapers, news, proceed by redundancy, in that they tell us what we\n\n\"must\" think, retain, expect, etc. Language is neither informational nor\n\ncommunica-tional. It is not the communication of information but\n\nsomething quite different: the transmission of order-words, either from\n\none statement to another or within each statement, insofar as each\n\nstatement accomplishes an act and the act is accomplished in the\n\nstatement. The most general schema of information science posits in\n\nprinciple an ideal state of maximum information and makes redundancy\n\nmerely a limitative condition serving to decrease this theoretical\n\nmaximum in order to prevent it from being drowned out by noise. We\n\nare saying that the redundancy of the order-word is instead primary and\n\nthat information is only the minimal condition for the transmission of\n\norder-words (which is why the opposition to be made is not between noise\n\nand information but between all the indisciplines at work in language,\n\nand the order-word as discipline or \"grammaticality\"). Redundancy has\n\ntwo forms, _frequency _and _resonance; _the first concerns the signifiance of\n\ninformation, the second (I = I) concerns the subjectivity of\n\ncommunication. It becomes apparent that information and\n\ncommunication, and even signifiance and subjectification, are subordinate\n\nto redundancy. A distinction is sometimes made between information\n\nand communication; some authors envision an abstract signifiance of\n\ninformation and an abstract subjectification of communication. None of\n\nthis, however, yields an implicit or primary form of language. There is no\n\nsignifiance independent of dominant significations, nor is there\n\nsubjectification independent of an established order of subjection.

The social character of enuncia-\n\ntion is intrinsically founded only if one succeeds in demonstrating how\n\nenunciation in itself implies _collective assemblages. _It then becomes clear\n\nthat the statement is individuated, and enunciation subjectified, only to\n\nthe extent that an impersonal collective assemblage requires it and deter-\n\nmines it to be so. It is for this reason that indirect discourse, _especially  \n\"free\" indirect discourse, _is of exemplary value: there are no clear,\ndistinc-\n\ntive contours; what comes first is not an insertion of variously individ-\n\nuated statements, or an interlocking of different subjects of enunciation,\n\nbut a collective assemblage resulting in the determination of relative\n\nsubjectification proceedings, or assignations of individuality and their\n\nshifting distributions within discourse. Indirect discourse is not explained\n\nby the distinction between subjects; rather, it is the assemblage, as it\nfreely\n\nappears in this discourse, that explains all the voices present within a\nsingle\n\nvoice, the glimmer of girls in a monologue by Charlus, the languages in a\n\nlanguage, the order-words in a word. The American murderer \"Son of\n\nSam\" killed on the prompting of an ancestral voice, itself transmitted\n\nthrough the voice of a dog. The notion of collective assemblage of enuncia-\n\ntion takes on primary importance since it is what must account for the\n\nsocial character. We can no doubt define the collective assemblage as the\n\nredundant complex of the act and the statement that necessarily accom-\n\nplishes it. But this is still only a nominal definition; it does not even\nenable\n\nus to justify our previous position that redundancy is irreducible to a sim-\n\nple identity (or that there is no simple identity between the statement and\n\nthe act). If we wish to move to a real definition of the collective\nassemblage,\n\nwe must ask of what consist these acts immanent to language that are in\n\nredundancy with statements or constitute order-words.\n\nThese acts seem to be defined as the set of all _incorporeal transforma-_\n\n_tions _current in a given society and _attributed to _the bodies of that\nsociety.\n\nWe may take the word \"body\" in its broadest sense (there are mental bod-\n\nies, souls are bodies, etc.). We must, however, distinguish between the\n\nactions and passions affecting those bodies, and acts, which are only\n\nnoncorporeal attributes or the \"expressed\" of a statement. When Ducrot\n\nasks what an act consists of, he turns precisely to the juridical assemblage,\n\ntaking the example of the judge's sentence that transforms the accused into\n\na convict.

Bodies have an age, they mature and grow\n\nold; but majority, retirement, any given age category, are incorporeal trans-\n\nformations that are immediately attributed to bodies in particular socie-\n\nties. \"You are no longer a child\": this statement concerns an incorporeal\n\ntransformation, even if it applies to bodies and inserts itself into their\n\nactions and passions. The incorporeal transformation is recognizable by\n\nits instantaneousness, its immediacy, by the simultaneity of the statement\n\nexpressing the transformation and the effect the transformation produces;\n\nthat is why order-words are precisely dated, to the hour, minute, and sec-\n\nond, and take effect the moment they are dated. Love is an intermingling of\n\nbodies that can be represented by a heart with an arrow through it, by a\n\nunion of souls, etc., but the declaration \"I love you\" expresses a\n\nnoncor-poreal attribute of bodies, the lover's as well as that of the loved\none.\n\nEating bread and drinking wine are interminglings of bodies; communing\n\nwith Christ is also an intermingling of bodies, properly spiritual bodies\n\nthat are no less \"real\" for being spiritual. But the transformation of the\n\nbody of the bread and the wine into the body and blood of Christ is the\n\npure expressed of a statement attributed to the bodies. In an airplane\n\nhijacking, the threat of a hijacker brandishing a revolver is obviously an\n\naction; so is the execution of the hostages, if it occurs. But the\n\ntransformation of the passengers into hostages, and of the plane-body\n\ninto a prison-body, is an instantaneous incorporeal transformation, a\n\n\"mass media act\" in the sense in which the English speak of \"speech\n\nacts.\" The order-words or assemblages of enunciation in a given society\n\n(in short, the illocutionary) designate this instantaneous relation between\n\nstatements and the incorporeal transformations or noncorporeal attributes\n\nthey express.\n\nThe instantaneousness of the order-word, which can be projected to\n\ninfinity, placed at the origin of society, is quite strange; for Rousseau, for\n\nexample, the passage from the state of nature to the social state is like a\nleap\n\nin place, an incorporeal transformation occurring at zero hour. Real his-\n\ntory undoubtedly recounts the actions and passions of the bodies that\n\ndevelop in a social field; it communicates them in a certain fashion; but it\n\nalso transmits order-words, in other words, pure acts intercalated into that\n\ndevelopment. History will never be rid of dates. Perhaps economics or\n\nfinancial analysis best demonstrates the presence and instantaneousness\n\nof these decisive acts in an overall process (that is why statements defi-\n\nnitely do not belong to ideology, but are already at work in what is suppos-\n\nedly the domain of the economic base).

Anybody\n\ncan shout, \"I declare a general mobilization,\" but in the absence of an effec-\n\ntuated variable giving that person the right to make such a statement it is an\n\nact of peurility or insanity, not an act of enunciation. This is also true of\n\"I\n\nlove you,\" which has neither meaning nor subject nor addressee outside of\n\ncircumstances that not only give it credibility but make it a veritable\n\nassemblage, a power marker, even in the case of an unhappy love (it is still\n\nby a will to power that one obeys...). The general term \"circumstances\"\n\nshould not leave the impression that it is a question only of external cir-\n\ncumstances. \"I swear\" is not the same when said in the family, at school, in\n\na love affair, in a secret society, or in court: it is not the same thing, and\nnei-\n\nther is it the same statement; it is not the same bodily situation, and\nneither\n\nis it the same incorporeal transformation. The transformation applies to\n\nbodies but is itself incorporeal, internal to enunciation. There are variables\n\nof expression _that establish a relation between language and the outside, but  \nprecisely because they are immanent to language. _As long as linguistics\n\nconfines itself to constants, whether syntactical, morphological, or pho-\n\nnological, it ties the statement to a signifier and enunciation to a subject\n\nand accordingly botches the assemblage; it consigns circumstances to the\n\nexterior, closes language in on itself, and makes pragmatics a residue. Prag-\n\nmatics, on the other hand, does not simply appeal to external circum-\n\nstances: it brings to light variables of expression or of enunciation that are\n\nso many internal reasons for language not to close itself off. As Volosinov\n\n[Bakhtin] says, as long as linguistics extracts constants, it is incapable of\nhelp-\n\ning us understand how a single word can be a complete enunciation; there\n\nmust be \"an extra something\" that \"remains outside of the scope of the entire\n\nset of linguistic categories and definitions,\" even though it is still\nentirely\n\nwithin the purview of the theory of enunciation or language.'\n\n3\n\nThe order-word\n\nis precisely that variable that makes the word as such an enunciation. The\n\ninstantaneousness of the order-word, its immediacy, gives it a power of varia-\n\ntion in relation to the bodies to which the transformation is attributed.\n\nPragmatics is a politics of language.

We may take\n\nas another example, under different conditions, the formation of a prop-\n\nerly Leninist type of statement in Soviet Russia, basing ourselves on a text\n\nby Lenin entitled \"On Slogans\" (1917). This text constituted an incorpo-\n\nreal transformation that extracted from the masses a proletarian class as an\n\nassemblage of enunciation _before _the conditions were present for the prole-\n\ntariat to exist as a body. A stroke of genius from the First Marxist Interna-\n\ntional, which \"invented\" a new type of class: Workers of the world, unite!\n\n14\n\nTaking advantage of the break with the Social Democrats, Lenin invented\n\nor decreed yet another incorporeal transformation that extracted from the\n\nproletarian class a vanguard as an assemblage of enunciation and was\n\nattributed to the \"Party,\" a new type of party as a distinct body, at the risk\nof\n\nfalling into a properly bureaucratic system of redundancy. The Leninist\n\nwager, an act of audacity? Lenin declared that the slogan _{mot d'ordre) _\"All\n\npower to the Soviets\" was valid only from the 27th of February to the 4th of\n\nJuly for the peacetime development of the Revolution, and no longer held\n\nin the state of war; the passage from peace to war implied this transforma-\n\ntion, not just from the masses to a guiding proletariat, but from the prole-\n\ntariat to a directing vanguard. _July 4 exactly _the power of the Soviets came\n\nto an end. All of the external circumstances can be assigned: the war as well\n\nas the insurrection that forced Lenin to flee to Finland. But the fact\n\nremains that the incorporeal transformation was uttered on the 4th of July,\n\nprior to the organization of the body to which it would be attributed,\n\nnamely, the Party itself. \"Every particular slogan must be deduced from the\n\ntotality of the specific features of a definite political situation.\"\n\n15\n\nIf the\n\nobjection is leveled that these specific features pertain to politics and not\n\nlinguistics, it must be observed how thoroughly politics works language\n\nfrom within, causing not only the vocabulary but also the structure and all\n\nof the phrasal elements to vary as the order-words change. A type of state-\n\nment can be evaluated only as a function of its pragmatic implications, in\n\nother words, in relation to the implicit presuppositions, immanent acts, or\n\nincorporeal transformations it expresses and which introduce new config-\n\nurations of bodies. True intuition is not a judgment of grammaticality but\n\nan evaluation of internal variables of enunciation in relation to the aggre-\n\ngate of the circumstances.\n\nWe have gone from explicit commands to order-words as implicit pre-\n\nsuppositions; from order-words to the immanent acts or incorporeal trans-\n\nformations they express; and from there to the assemblages of enunciation\n\nwhose variables they are.

Moreover, at a later time there\n\nwill arise new order-words that will modify the variables and will not yet be\n\npart of a known regime. Thus the order-word is redundancy in several\n\nways: as a function of the process of transmission essential to it, and in\n\nitself, from the time it is emitted, in its \"immediate\" relation with the act\nor\n\ntransformation it effectuates. The order-word is already redundancy even\n\nwhen it is in rupture with a particular semiotic. That is why every state-\n\nment of a collective assemblage of enunciation belongs to indirect dis-\n\ncourse. Indirect discourse is the presence of a reported statement within\n\nthe reporting statement, the presence of an order-word within the word.\n\nLanguage in its entirety is indirect discourse. Indirect discourse in no way\n\nsupposes direct discourse; rather, the latter is extracted from the former, to\n\nthe extent that the operations of signifiance and proceedings of\n\nsubjec-tification in an assemblage are distributed, attributed, and\n\nassigned, or that the variables of the assemblage enter into constant\n\nrelations, however temporarily. Direct discourse is a detached fragment of\n\na mass and is born of the dismemberment of the collective assemblage;\n\nbut the collective assemblage is always like the murmur from which I take\n\nmy proper name, the constellation of voices, concordant or not, from which\n\nI draw my voice. I always depend on a molecular assemblage of\n\nenunciation that is not given in my conscious mind, any more than it\n\ndepends solely on my apparent social determinations, which combine\n\nmany heterogeneous regimes of signs.

When we ask what faculty is specific to the order-word, we must\n\nindeed attribute to it some strange characteristics: a kind of\n\ninstantaneousness in the emission, perception, and transmission of\n\norder-words; a wide variability, and a power of forgetting permitting one to\n\nfeel absolved of the order-words one has followed and then abandoned in\n\norder to welcome others; a properly ideal or ghostly capacity for the appre-\n\nhension of incorporeal transformations; an aptitude for grasping language\n\nas an immense indirect discourse.'\n\n7\n\nThe faculty of the cuer and the cued, of\n\nthe song that always holds a tune within a tune in a relation of redundancy;\n\na faculty that is in truth mediumistic, glossolalic, or xenoglossic.\n\nLet us return to the question of how this defines a language-function, a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)106.png)\n\n0\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS \u25a1 85\n\nfunction coextensive with language. It is evident that order-words, collec-\n\ntive assemblages, or regimes of signs cannot be equated with language. But\n\nthey effectuate its condition of possibility _{the superlinearity of expres-  \nsion), _they fulfill in each instance this condition of possibility; without\n\nthem, language would remain a pure virtuality (the superlinear character\n\nof indirect discourse). Doubtless, the assemblages vary, undergo transfor-\n\nmation. But they do not necessarily vary by language, they do not corre-\n\nspond to the various languages. A language seems to be defined by the\n\nsyntactical, semantic, phonological constants in its statements; the collec-\n\ntive assemblage, on the contrary, concerns the usage of these constants in\n\nrelation to variables internal to enunciation itself (variables of expression,\n\nimmanent acts, or incorporeal transformations). Different constants, dif-\n\nferent languages, may have the same usage; the same constants in a given\n\nlanguage may have different usages, successively or even simultaneously.\n\nWe cannot content ourselves with a duality between constants as linguistic\n\nfactors that are explicit or potentially explicit, and variables as extrinsic,\n\nnonlinguistic factors. For the pragmatic variables of usage are internal to\n\nenunciation and constitute the implicit presuppositions of language. Thus\n\nif the collective assemblage is in each instance coextensive with the linguis-\n\ntic system considered, and to language as a whole, it is because it expresses\n\nthe set of incorporeal transformations that effectuate the condition of pos-\n\nsibility of language and utilize the elements of the linguistic system. The\n\nlanguage-function thus defined is neither informational nor\n\ncommuni-cational; it has to do neither with signifying information nor\n\nwith intersubjective communication. And it is useless to abstract a\n\nsignifiance outside information, or a subjectivity outside communication.\n\nFor the subjectification proceedings and movement of signifiance relate\n\nto regimes of signs, or collective assemblages. The language-function is\n\nthe transmission of order-words, and order-words relate to assemblages,\n\njust as assemblages relate to the incorporeal transformations constituting\n\nthe variables of the function.

Precisely because content, like\n\nexpression, has a form of its own, one can never assign the form of expres-\n\nsion the function of simply representing, describing, or averring a corre-\n\nsponding content: there is neither correspondence nor conformity. The\n\ntwo formalizations are not of the same nature; they are independent, heter-\n\nogeneous. The Stoics were the first to theorize this independence: they dis-\n\ntinguished between the actions and passions of bodies (using the word\n\n\"body\" in the broadest sense, as applying to any formed content) and\n\nincorporeal acts (the \"expressed\" of the statements). The form of expres-\n\nsion is constituted by the warp of expresseds, and the form of content by the\n\nwoof of bodies. When knife cuts flesh, when food or poison spreads\n\nthrough the body, when a drop of wine falls into water, there is an _intermin-  \ngling of bodies; _but the statements, \"The knife is cutting the flesh,\" \"I am\n\neating,\" \"The water is turning red,\" express _incorporeal transformations _of\n\nan entirely different nature (events).\n\n18\n\nThe genius of the Stoics was to have\n\ntaken this paradox as far as it could go, up to the point of insanity and\ncyni-\n\ncism, and to have grounded it in the most serious of principles: their reward\n\nwas to be the first to develop a philosophy of language.\n\nThe paradox gets us nowhere unless, like the Stoics, we add that incorpo-\n\nreal transformations, incorporeal attributes, apply to bodies, and only to\n\nbodies. They are the expressed of statements but are _attributed _to bodies.\n\nThe purpose is not to describe or represent bodies; bodies already have\n\nproper qualities, actions and passions, souls, in short forms, which are\n\nthemselves bodies. Representations are bodies too! If noncorporeal attri-\n\nbutes apply to bodies, if there are good grounds for making a distinction\n\nbetween the incorporeal expressed \"to become red\" and the corporeal\n\nquality \"red,\" etc., it has nothing to with representation. We cannot even\n\nsay that the body or state of things is the \"referent\" of the sign. In\nexpressing\n\nthe noncorporeal attribute, and by that token attributing it to the body, one\n\nis not representing or referring but _intervening _in a way; it is a speech\nact.\n\nThe independence of the two kinds of forms, forms of expression and\n\nforms of content, is not contradicted but confirmed by the fact that the\n\nexpressions or expresseds are inserted into or intervene in contents, not to\n\nrepresent them but to anticipate them or move them back, slow them down\n\nor speed them up, separate or combine them, delimit them in a different\n\nway. The warp of the instantaneous transformations is always inserted into\n\nthe woof of the continuous modifications. (Hence the significance of dates\n\nfor the Stoics.

The\n\nindependence of the form of expression and the form of content is not the\n\nbasis for a parallelism between them or a representation of one by the other,\n\nbut on the contrary a parceling of the two, a manner in which expressions\n\nare inserted into contents, in which we ceaselessly jump from one register\n\nto another, in which signs are at work in things themselves just as things\n\nextend into or are deployed through signs. An assemblage of enunciation\n\ndoes not speak \"of\" things; it speaks _on the same level as _states of things\nand\n\nstates of content. So that the same x, the same particle, may function either\n\nas a body that acts and undergoes actions or as a sign constituting an act or\n\norder-word, depending on which form it is taken up by (for example, the\n\ntheoretico-experimental aggregate of physics). In short, the functional in-\n\ndependence of the two forms is only the form of their reciprocal presup-\n\nposition, and of the continual passage from one to the other. We are never\n\npresented with an interlinkage of order-words and a causality of contents\n\neach in its own right; nor do we see one represent the other, with the second\n\nserving as referent. On the contrary, the independence of the two lines is\n\ndistributive, such that a segment of one always forms a relay with a segment\n\nof the other, slips into, introduces itself into the other. We constantly pass\n\nfrom order-words to the \"silent order\" of things, as Foucault puts it, and\n\nvice versa.\n\nBut when we use a word as vague as \"intervene,\" when we say that\n\nexpressions intervene or insert themselves into contents, are we not still\n\nprey to a kind of idealism in which the order-word instantaneously falls\n\nfrom the sky? What we must determine is not an origin but points of inter-\n\nvention or insertion in the framework of the reciprocal presupposition of\n\nthe two forms. Both forms of content and forms of expression are insepara-\n\nble from a movement of deterritorialization that carries them away. Both\n\nexpression and content are more or less deterritorialized, relatively\n\ndeterritorialized, according to the particular state of their form. In this\n\nrespect, one cannot posit a primacy of expression over content, or content\n\nover expression. Sometimes the semiotic components are more deter-\n\nritorialized than the material components, and sometimes the reverse. For\n\nexample, a mathematical complex of signs may be more deterritorialized\n\nthan a set of particles; conversely, the particles may have experimental\n\neffects that deterritorialize the semiotic system. A criminal action may be\n\ndeterritorializing in relation to the existing regime of signs (the earth\ncries\n\nfor revenge and crumbles beneath my feet, my offense is too great); but the\n\nsign that expresses the act of condemnation may in turn be deter-\n\nritorializing in relation to all actions and reactions (\"a fugitive and a\n\nvagabond shalt thou be in the earth\" [Gen. 4:12], you cannot even be\n\nkilled).

What we call circum-\n\nstances or variables are these degrees themselves. There are _variables of  \ncontent, _or proportions in the interminglings or aggregations of bodies, and\n\nthere are _variables of expression, _factors internal to enunciation. Germany,\n\ntoward November 20, 1923: on the one hand, the deterritorializing infla-\n\ntion of the monetary body and, on the other, in response to the inflation, a\n\nsemiotic transformation of the reichsmark into the rentenmark, making\n\npossible a reterritorialization. Russia, toward July 4,1917: on the one hand\n\nproportions of a state of \"bodies\" Soviets-provisional government, and on\n\nthe other the elaboration of a Bolshevik incorporeal semiotic, accelerating\n\nthings and contributing to the action of the detonating body of the Party. In\n\nshort, the way an expression relates to a content is not by uncovering or rep-\n\nresenting it. Rather, forms of expression and forms of content communi-\n\ncate through a conjunction of their quanta of relative deterritorialization,\n\neach intervening, operating in the other.\n\nWe may draw some general conclusions on the nature of Assemblages\n\nfrom this. On a first, horizontal, axis, an assemblage comprises two seg-\n\nments, one of content, the other of expression. On the one hand it is a  \n_machinic assemblage _of bodies, of actions and passions, an intermingling\n\nof bodies reacting to one another; on the other hand it is a _collective\nassem-  \nblage of enunciation, _of acts and statements, of incorporeal transforma-\n\ntions attributed to bodies. Then on a vertical axis, the assemblage has both  \n_territorial sides, _or reterritorialized sides, which stabilize it, and\n_cutting  \nedges of deterritorialization, _which carry it away. No one is better than\n\nKafka at differentiating the two axes of the assemblage and making them\n\nfunction together. On the one hand, the ship-machine, the hotel-machine,\n\nthe circus-machine, the castle-machine, the court-machine, each with its\n\nown intermingled pieces, gears, processes, and bodies contained in one\n\nanother or bursting out of containment (see the head bursting through the\n\nroof)\n\n19\n\nOn the other hand, the regime of signs or of enunciation: each\n\nregime with its incorporeal transformations, acts, death sentences and\n\njudgments, proceedings, \"law.\" It is obvious that statements do not repre-\n\nsent machines: the Stoker's discourse does not describe stoking as a body; it\n\nhas its own form, and a development without resemblance.\n\n20\n\nYet it is\n\nattributed to bodies, to the whole ship as a body. A discourse of submission\n\nto order-words; a discourse of discussion, claims, accusation, and defense.\n\nOn the second axis, what is compared or combined of the two aspects, what\n\nalways inserts one into the other, are the sequenced or conjugated degrees\n\nof deterritorialization, and the operations of reterritorialization that\nstabi-\n\nlize the aggregate at a given moment.

Taking the feudal assemblage as an\n\nexample, we would have to consider the interminglings of bodies defining\n\nfeudalism: the body of the earth and the social body; the body of the over-\n\nlord, vassal, and serf; the body of the knight and the horse and their new\n\nrelation to the stirrup; the weapons and tools assuring a symbiosis of\n\nbodies\u2014a whole machinic assemblage. We would also have to consider\n\nstatements, expressions, the juridical regime of heraldry, all of the incorpo-\n\nreal transformations, in particular, oaths and their variables (the oath of\n\nobedience, but also the oath of love, etc.): the collective assemblage of\n\nenunciation. On the other axis, we would have to consider the feudal\n\nterritorialities and reterritorializations, and at the same time the line of\n\ndeterritorialization that carries away both the knight and his mount, state-\n\nments and acts. We would have to consider how all this combines in the\n\nCrusades.\n\nIt would be an error to believe that content determines expression by\n\ncausal action, even if expression is accorded the power not only to \"reflect\"\n\ncontent but to react upon it in an active way. This kind of ideological con-\n\nception of the statement, which subordinates it to a primary economic con-\n\ntent, runs into all kinds of difficulties inherent to dialectics. First,\nalthough\n\nit may be possible to conceive of a causal action moving from content to\n\nexpression, the same cannot be said for the respective _forms, _the form of\n\ncontent and the form of expression. We must recognize that expression is\n\nindependent and that this is precisely what enables it to react upon con-\n\ntents. This independence, however, has been poorly conceived. If contents\n\nare said to be economic, the form of content cannot be said to be economic\n\nand is reduced to a pure abstraction, namely, the production of goods and\n\nthe means of that production considered in themselves. Similarly, if ex-\n\npressions are said to be ideological, the form of expression is not said to be\n\nideological and is reduced to language as abstraction, as the availability of\na\n\ngood shared by all. Those who take this approach claim to characterize\n\ncontents and expressions by all the struggles and conflicts pervading them\n\nin two different forms, but these forms themselves are exempt from strug-\n\ngle and conflict, and the relation between them remains entirely indeter-\n\nminate.\n\n21\n\nThe only way to define the relation is to revamp the theory of\n\nideology by saying that expressions and statements intervene directly in\n\nproductivity, in the form of a production of meaning or sign-value. The\n\ncategory of production doubtless has the advantage of breaking with\n\nschemas of representation, information, and communication. But is it any\n\nmore adequate than these schemas?

What\n\nregulates the obligatory, necessary, or permitted interminglings of bodies\n\nis above all an alimentary regime and a sexual regime. Even technology\n\nmakes the mistake of considering tools in isolation: tools exist only in rela-\n\ntion to the interminglings they make possible or that make them possible.\n\nThe stirrup entails a new man-horse symbiosis that at the same time entails\n\nnew weapons and new instruments. Tools are inseparable from symbioses\n\nor amalgamations defining a Nature-Society machinic assemblage. They\n\npresuppose a social machine that selects them and takes them into its \"phy-\n\nlum\": a society is defined by its amalgamations, not by its tools. Similarly,\n\nthe semiotic or collective aspect of an assemblage relates not to a produc-\n\ntivity of language but to regimes of signs, to a machine of expression whose\n\nvariables determine the usage of language elements. These elements do not\n\nstand on their own any more than tools do. There is a primacy of the\n\nmachinic assemblage of bodies over tools and goods, a primacy of the col-\n\nlective assemblage of enunciation over language and words. The articula-\n\ntion of the two aspects of the assemblage is effected by the movements of\n\ndeterritorialization that quantify their forms. That is why a social field is\n\ndefined less by its conflicts and contradictions than by the lines of flight\n\nrunning through it. An assemblage has neither base nor superstructure,\n\nneither deep structure nor superficial structure; it flattens all of its\ndimen-\n\nsions onto a single plane of consistency upon which reciprocal presupposi-\n\ntions and mutual insertions play themselves out.\n\nThe other mistake (which is combined with the first as needed) is to\n\nbelieve in the adequacy of the form of expression as a linguistic system.\n\nThis system may be conceived as a signifying phonological structure, or as\n\na deep syntactical structure. In either case, it is credited with engendering\n\nsemantics, therefore of fulfilling expression, whereas contents are rele-\n\ngated to the arbitrariness of a simple \"reference\" and pragmatics to the\n\nexteriority of nonlinguistic factors.

But if the abstraction is\ntaken  \nfurther, one necessarily reaches a level where the pseudoconstants of lan-  \nguage are superseded by variables of expression internal to enunciation  \nitself; these variables of expression are then no longer separable from the  \nvariables of content with which they are in perpetual interaction. _If the  \nexternal pragmatics of nonlinguistic factors must be taken into considera-  \ntion, it is because linguistics itself is inseparable from an internal prag-  \nmatics involving its own factors. _It is not enough to take into account the  \nsignified, or even the referent, because the very notions of signification  \nand reference are bound up with a supposedly autonomous and constant  \nstructure. There is no use constructing a semantics, or even recognizing a  \ncertain validity to pragmatics, if they are still pretreated by a phonological  \nor syntactical machine. For a true abstract machine pertains to an assem-  \nblage in its entirety: it is defined as the diagram of that assemblage. It is\nnot  \nlanguage based but diagrammatic and superlinear. Content is not a signi-  \nfied nor expression a signifier; rather, both are variables of the assemblage.  \nWe get nowhere until the pragmatic, but also semantic, syntactical, and  \nphonological determinations are directly linked to the assemblages of  \nenunciation upon which they depend. Chomsky's abstract machine retains  \nan arborescent model and a linear ordering of linguistic elements in sen-  \ntences and sentence combinations. But as soon as pragmatic values or  \ninternal variables are taken into account, in particular with respect to indi-  \nrect discourse, one is obliged to bring \"hypersentences\" into play or to con-  \nstruct \"abstract objects\" (incorporeal transformations). This implies  \nsuperlinearity, in other words, a plane whose elements no longer have a  \nfixed linear order: the rhizome model.\n\n22\n\nFrom this standpoint, the\n\ninter-penetration of language and the social field and political problems  \nlies at the deepest level of the abstract machine, not at the surface. The  \nabstract machine as it relates to the diagram of the assemblage is never  \npurely a matter of language, except for lack of sufficient abstraction. It is  \nlanguage that depends on the abstract machine, not the reverse. At most,  \nwe may distinguish in the abstract machine two states of the diagram,  \none in which variables of content and expression are distributed according  \nto their heterogeneous forms in reciprocal presupposition on a plane of  \nconsistency, and another in which it is no longer even possible to  \ndistinguish between variables of content and expression because the  \nvariability of that same plane has prevailed over the duality of forms,  \nrendering them \"indiscernible.\" (The first state relates to still relative  \nmovements of deterritori-alization; in the second, an absolute threshold  \nof deterritorialization has been reached.)\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)113.png)\n\n92 \u25a1 NOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\nIII. **\"There Are Constants or Universals of Language That Enable Us to **\n\n**Define It as a Homogeneous System\"**\n\nThe question of structural invariants\u2014and the very idea of structure is\n\ninseparable from invariants, whether atomic or relational\u2014is essential to\n\nlinguistics. It is what allows linguistics to claim a basis in pure\nscientificity,\n\nto be nothing but science ... safe from any supposedly external or prag-\n\nmatic factor. The question of invariants assumes several closely connected\n\nforms: (1) the constants of a language (phonological, by commutativity;\n\nsyntactical, by transformativity; semantic, by generativity); (2) the uni-\n\nversals of language (by decomposition of the phoneme into distinctive\n\nfeatures; of syntax into fundamental constituents; of signification into\n\nminimal semantic elements); (3) trees linking constants to one another,\n\nwith binary relations between trees (see Chomsky's linear arborescent\n\nmethod); (4) competence, in principle coextensive with language and\n\ndefined by judgments of grammaticality; (5) homogeneity, bearing on ele-\n\nments and relations as well as intuitive judgments; (6) synchrony, which\n\nerects an \"in-itself' and a \"for-itself' of language, perpetually moving from\n\nthe objective system to the subjective consciousness that apprehends its\n\nprinciple (that of the linguist himself or herself).\n\nOne can juggle all of these factors, subtract some or even add new ones.\n\nThey go together, however, because the essentials of all of them are present\n\non the level of any one. For example, the distinction between speech and\n\nlanguage is recapitulated in the distinction between competence and per-\n\nformance, but at the level of grammaticality. If it is objected that the dis-\n\ntinction between competence and performance is entirely relative (a\n\nlinguistic competence can be economic, religious, political, or aesthetic,\n\netc.; the teaching competence of a grade school teacher may be only a per-\n\nformance in relation to the judgment of an inspector or government regula-\n\ntions), linguists respond that they are willing to multiply levels of\n\ncompetence, and even to introduce pragmatic values into the system.\n\nBrekle, for example, proposes adding an \"idiosyncratic performatory com-\n\npetence\" factor tied to a whole constellation of linguistic, psychological, or\n\nsociological factors. But what use is this injection of pragmatics if\n\npragmatics is in turn considered to have constants or universals of its own?\n\nAnd in what way are expressions like \"I,\" \"promise,\" \"know\" more univer-\n\nsal than \"greet,\" \"name,\" or \"condemn\"?\n\n23\n\nSimilarly, when efforts are\n\nmade to make Chomsky's trees bud and to shatter linear order, as long as\n\nthe pragmatic components marking the ruptures are placed above the tree\n\nor effaced from the derivation nothing has really been accomplished, one\n\nhas failed to constitute a rhizome.\n\n24\n\nIn truth, the nature of the abstract\n\nmachine is the most general problem: there is no reason to tie the abstract\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)114.png)\n\n0\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS \u25a1 93\n\nto the universal or the constant, or to efface the singularity of abstract  \nmachines insofar as they are built around variables and variations.\n\nThe debate between Chomsky and Labov will give us a better under-\n\nstanding of what the issue is. Every language is an essentially heterogene-  \nous reality; linguists know this and say so. But this is a _factual _remark.  \nChomsky asks only that one carve from this aggregate a homogeneous or  \nstandard system as a basis for abstraction or idealization, making possible  \na scientific study _of principles. _Limiting oneself to standard English is\nthus  \nnot the issue, for even a linguist who studies Black English or the English of  \nthe ghettos is obliged to extract a standard system guaranteeing the con-  \nstancy and homogeneity of the object under study (no science can operate  \nany other way, they say). Thus Chomsky pretends to believe that by assert-  \ning his interest in the variable features of language, Labov is situating him-  \nself in a de facto pragmatics external to linguistics.\n\n25\n\nLabov, however, has\n\nother ambitions. When he brings to light lines _of inherent variation, _he\ndoes  \nnot see them simply as \"free variants\" pertaining to pronunciation, style,  \nor nonpertinent features that lie outside the system and leave the homoge-  \nneity of the system intact; neither does he see them as a de facto mix  \nbetween two systems, each homogeneous in its own right, as if the speaker  \nmoved from one to the other. He refuses the alternative linguistics set up  \nfor itself: assigning variants to different systems, or relegating them to a  \nplace outside the structure. It is the variation itself that is systematic, in\nthe  \nsense in which musicians say that \"the theme is the variation.\" Labov sees  \nvariation as a de jure component affecting each system from within, send-  \ning it cascading or leaping on its own power and forbidding one to close it  \noff, to make it homogeneous in principle. Labov does consider variables of  \nall kinds, phonetic, phonological, syntactical, semantic, stylistic. Yet it  \nwould seem difficult to accuse him of missing the distinction between the  \nde jure and the de facto\u2014or between linguistics and stylistics, or  \nsynchrony and diachrony, or pertinent and nonpertinent features, or com-  \npetence and performance, or the grammaticality of language and the  \nagrammaticality of speech. Although this may be hardening his positions,  \nwe would say rather that Labov proposes a different distribution of the de  \nfacto and the de jure, and especially a different conception of the de jure  \nitself and of abstraction. He takes the example of a young black person  \nwho, in a very short series of phrases, seems to pass from the Black English  \nsystem to the standard system eighteen times. Is it not the abstract distinc-  \ntion between the two systems that proves arbitrary and insufficient?

In the course\n\nof a single day, an individual repeatedly passes from language to language.\n\nHe successively speaks as \"father to son\" and as a boss; to his lover, he\n\nspeaks an infantilized language; while sleeping he is plunged into an oniric\n\ndiscourse, then abruptly returns to a professional language when the tele-\n\nphone rings. It will be objected that these variations are extrinsic, that it\nis\n\nstill the same language. But that is to prejudge the question. First, it is\nnot\n\ncertain that the phonology is the same, nor the syntax, nor the semantics.\n\nSecond, the whole question is whether this supposedly identical language\n\nis defined by invariants or, on the contrary, by the line of continuous varia-\n\ntion running through it. Some linguists have suggested that linguistic\n\nchange occurs less by systemic rupture than by a gradual modification of\n\nfrequency, by a coexistence and continuity of different usages. Take as an\n\nexample the statement, \"I swear!\" It is a different statement depending on\n\nwhether it is said by a child to his or her father, by a man in love to his\nloved\n\none, or by a witness before the court. These are like three sequences. (Or\n\nMessiaen's four \"amen\"s stretched over seven sequences.) Once again,\n\nthere is no reason to say that the variables are merely situational, and that\n\nthe statement remains constant in principle. Not only are there as many\n\nstatements as there are effectuations, but all of the statements are present\n\nin the effectuation of one among them, so that the line of variation is vir-\n\ntual, in other words, real without being actual, and consequently continu-\n\nous regardless of the leaps the statement makes. To place the statement in\n\ncontinuous variation is to send it through all the prosodic, semantic, syn-\n\ntactical, and phonological variables that can affect it in the shortest\n\nmoment of time (the smallest interval). Build the _continuum _of \"I swear!\"\n\nwith the corresponding transformations. This is the standpoint of\n\npragmatics, but a pragmatics internal to language, immanent, including\n\nvariations of linguistic elements of all kinds. For example, Kafka's line of\n\nthe three proceedings: the father's proceedings in the family; the engage-\n\nment proceedings at the hotel; and the court proceedings. There is a con-\n\nstant tendency to seek a \"reduction\": everything is explained by the\n\nsituation of the child in relation to its father, or of the man in relation to\n\ncastration, or of the citizen in relation to the law. But this is to content\none-\n\nself with extracting a pseudoconstant of content, which is no better than\n\nextracting a pseudoconstant of expression.

A\n\nvariable can be continuous over a portion of its trajectory, then leap or\nskip,\n\nwithout that affecting its continuous variation; what this does is impose an\n\nabsent development as an \"alternative continuity\" that is virtual yet real.\n\nA constant or invariant is defined less by its permanence and duration\n\nthan by its function as a center, if only relative. In the tonal or diatonic\nsys-\n\ntem of music, laws of resonance and attraction determine centers valid for\n\nall modes and endowed with stability and attractive power _(pouvoir). _These\n\ncenters therefore organize distinct, distinctive, forms that are clearly\nestab-\n\nlished for a certain amount of time: a linear, codified, centered system of\n\nthe arborescent type. It is true that the minor \"mode\" gives tonal music a\n\ndecentered, runaway, fugitive character due to the nature of its intervals\n\nand the lesser stability of its chords. This mode thus has the ambiguity of\n\nundergoing operations that align it to a major model or standard at the\n\nsame time as it continues to display a certain modal power _(puissance) _irre-\n\nducible to tonality, as though music set out on a journey and garnered all\n\nresurgences, phantoms of the Orient, imaginary lands, traditions from all\n\nover. But temperament, tempered chromaticism has an even greater ambi-\n\nguity: stretching the action of the center to the most distant tones, but also\n\npreparing the disaggregation of the central principle, replacing the cen-\n\ntered forms of continuous development with a form that constantly dis-\n\nsolves and transforms itself. When development subordinates form and\n\nspans the whole, as in Beethoven, variation begins to free itself and\n\nbecomes identified with creation. But when chromaticism is unleashed,\n\nbecomes a generalized chromaticism, turns back against temperament,\n\naffecting not only pitches but all sound components\u2014durations, intensi-\n\nties, timbre, attacks\u2014it becomes impossible to speak of a sound form\n\norganizing matter; it is no longer even possible to speak of a continuous\n\ndevelopment of form. Rather, it is a question of a highly complex and elab-\n\norate material making audible nonsonorous forces. The couple\n\nmatter-form is replaced by the coupling material-forces. The synthesizer\n\nhas taken the place of the old \"a priori synthetic judgment,\" and all\n\nfunctions change accordingly. By placing all its components in continuous\n\nvariation, music itself becomes a superlinear system, a rhizome instead of\n\na tree, and enters the service of a virtual cosmic continuum of which even\n\nholes, silences, ruptures, and breaks are a part. Thus the important thing is\n\ncertainly not to establish a pseudobreak between the tonal system and\n\natonal music; the latter, on the contrary, in breaking away from the tonal\n\nsystem, only carried temperament to its ultimate conclusion (although no\n\nViennese stopped there). The essential thing is almost the opposite\n\nmovement: the ferment in the tonal system itself (during much of the\n\nnineteenth and twentieth cen-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)117.png)\n\n0\n\n96 \u25a1\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\nturies) that dissolved temperament and widened chromaticism while pre-\n\nserving a relative tonality, which reinvented new modalities, brought a new\n\namalgamation of major and minor, and in each instance conquered realms\n\nof continuous variation for this variable or that. This ferment came to the\n\nforefront and made itself heard in its own right; and, through the molecular\n\nmaterial thus wrought, it made audible the nonsonorous forces of the\n\ncosmos that have always agitated music\u2014a bit of Time in the pure state,\n\n27\n\na\n\ngrain of absolute Intensity... The words \"tonal,\" \"modal,\" \"atonal\" do not\n\nmean much. Music is not alone in being art as cosmos and in drawing the\n\nvirtual lines of an infinite variation.\n\nOnce again, the objection will be raised that music is not a language, that\n\nthe components of sound are not pertinent features of language, that there\n\nis no correspondence between the two. We are not suggesting any corre-\n\nspondence. We keep asking that the issue be left open, that any presup-\n\nposed distinction be rejected. This especially applies to the\n\nlanguage-speech distinction, which is used to relegate all kinds of\n\nvariables at work within expression and enunciation to a position outside\n\nlanguage. The Voice-Music relation proposed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau,\n\non the other hand, could have taken not only phonetics and prosody but all\n\nof linguistics in a different direction. The voice in music has always been\n\na privileged axis of experimentation, playing simultaneously on language\n\nand sound. Music has linked the voice to instruments in various ways; but\n\nas long as the voice is song, its main role is to \"hold\" sound, it functions\nas\n\na constant circumscribed on a note and _accompanied _by the instrument.\n\nOnly when the voice is tied to timbre does it reveal a tessitura that\n\nrenders it heterogeneous to itself and gives it a power of continuous\n\nvariation: it is then no longer accompanied, but truly \"machined,\" it\n\nbelongs to a musical machine that prolongs or superposes on a single\n\nplane parts that are spoken, sung, achieved by special effects, instrumental,\n\nor perhaps electronically generated. This is the sound plane of a\n\ngeneralized \"glissando\" implying the constitution of a statistical space in\n\nwhich each variable has, not an average value, but a probability of\n\nfrequency that places it in continuous variation with the other variables.\n\n28\n\nLuciano Berio's _Visage _(Face) and Dieter Schnebel's _Glossolalie _\n\n(Speaking in tongues) are typical examples of this. And despite what Berio\n\nhimself says, it is less a matter of using pseudoconstants to produce a\n\nsimulacrum of language or a metaphor for the voice than of attaining that\n\nsecret neuter language without constants and entirely in indirect discourse\n\nwhere the synthesizer and the instrument speak no less than the voice, and\n\nthe voice plays no less than the instrument. It should not be thought that\n\nmusic has forgotten how to sing in a now mechanical and atomized\n\nworld; rather, an immense coefficient of variation is affecting and carrying\n\naway all of the phatic, aphatic, linguistic,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)118.png)\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS \u25a1 97\n\npoetic, instrumental, or musical parts of a single sound assemblage\u2014\"a\n\nsimple scream suffusing all degrees\" (Thomas Mann). There are many pro-\n\ncedures for placing the voice in variation, not only _Sprechgesang _\n\n(speech-song), which constantly leaves pitch behind by descent or ascent,\n\nbut also circular breathing techniques and zones of resonance in which\n\nseveral voices seem to issue from the same mouth. Secret languages are\n\nvery significant in this connection, in learned as well as popular music.\n\nCertain ethnomusicologists have found extraordinary cases (in Dahomey,\n\nfor example) where a first, diatonic, vocal part is superseded by a\n\nchromatic descent into a secret language that slips from one sound to the\n\nnext in a continuous fashion, modulating a sound continuum into smaller\n\nand smaller intervals until it becomes a \"parlando\" all of the intervals of\n\nwhich blur together\u2014and then the diatonic part is itself transposed\n\naccording to the chromatic levels of a terraced architecture, the song\n\nsometimes interrupted by a parlando, by a simple conversation lacking\n\ndefinite pitch.\n\n29\n\nIt is perhaps characteristic of secret languages, slangs,\n\njargons, professional languages, nursery rhymes, merchants' cries to stand\n\nout less for their lexical inventions or rhetorical figures than for the way\n\nin which they effect continuous variations of the common elements of\n\nlanguage. They are chromatic languages, close to a musical notation. A\n\nsecret language does not merely have a hidden cipher or code still\n\noperating by constants and forming a subsystem; _it places the public  \nlanguage's system of variables in a state ofvariation._\n\nThis is what we are getting at: a generalized chromaticism. Placing ele-\n\nments of any nature in continuous variation is an operation that will per-\n\nhaps give rise to new distinctions, but takes none as final and has none in\n\nadvance. On the contrary, this operation in principle bears on the voice,\n\nspeech, language, and music simultaneously. There is no reason to make\n\nprior, principled distinctions. Linguistics in general is still in a kind of\n\nmajor mode, still has a sort of diatonic scale and a strange taste for domi-\n\nnants, constants, and universals. All languages, in the meantime, are in\n\nimmanent continuous variation: neither synchrony nor diachrony, but\n\nasynchrony, chromaticism as a variable and continuous state of language.\n\nFor a chromatic linguistics according pragmatism its intensities and\n\nvalues.\n\nWhat is called a style can be the most natural thing in the world; it is\n\nnothing other than the procedure of a continuous variation. Of the dual-\n\nisms established by linguistics, there are few with a more shaky foundation\n\nthan the separation between linguistics and stylistics: Because a style is not\n\nan individual psychological creation but an assemblage of enunciation, it\n\nunavoidably produces a language within a language. Take an arbitrary list\n\nof authors we are fond of: Kafka once again, Beckett, Gherasim Luca, Jean-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)119.png)\n\n0\n\n98 \u25a1\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\nLuc Godard.

But this is only circumstantial, an oppor-\n\ntunity, and the opportunity can be found elsewhere. It will also be noted\n\nthat many of them are not only or not primarily writers (Beckett and\n\ntheater and television, Godard and film and television, Luca and his\n\naudiovisual machines). The reason for this is that when one submits lin-\n\nguistic elements to a treatment producing continuous variation, when one\n\nintroduces an internal pragmatics into language, one is necessarily led to\n\ntreat nonlinguistic elements such as gestures and instruments in the same\n\nfashion, as if the two aspects of pragmatics joined on the same line of varia-\n\ntion, in the same continuum. Moreover, the idea perhaps comes first from\n\noutside, with language following only later, as with the necessarily exterior\n\nsources of a style. But the essential thing is that each of these authors has\nhis\n\nown procedure of variation, his own widened chromaticism, his own mad\n\nproduction of speeds and intervals. The creative stammering of Gherasim\n\nLuca, in the poem \"Passionnement\" (Passionately).\n\n30\n\nGodard's is another\n\nkind of stammering. In theater: Robert Wilson's whispering, without defi-\n\nnite pitch, and Carmelo Bene's ascending and descending variations.\n\n31\n\nIt's\n\neasy to stammer, but making language itself stammer is a different affair; it\n\ninvolves placing all linguistic, and even nonlinguistic, elements in varia-\n\ntion, both variables of expression and variables of content. A new form of\n\nredundancy,\n\nAND\n\n...\n\nAND\n\n...\n\nAND\n\n...

From one to the other,\n\neverything shifts. Writers in British or American English have been more\n\nconscious than the French of this struggle and the stakes involved, and of\n\nthe valence of the \"and.\"\n\n32\n\nIt was Proust who said that \"masterpieces are\n\nwritten in a kind of foreign language.\" That is the same as stammering,\n\nmaking language stammer rather than stammering in speech.

Continuous varia-\n\ntion has only ascetic lines, a touch of herb and pure water.\n\nIt is possible to take any linguistic variable and place it in variation fol-\n\nlowing a necessarily virtual continuous line between two of its states. We\n\nare no longer in the situation of linguists who expect the constants of lan-\n\nguage to experience a kind of mutation or undergo the effects of changes\n\naccumulated in speech alone. Lines of change or creation are fully and\n\ndirectly a part of the abstract machine. Hjelmslev remarked that a language\n\nnecessarily includes unexploited possibilities or potentialities and that the\n\nabstract machine must include these possibilities or potentialities.\n\n33\n\n\"Potential\" and \"virtual\" are not at all in opposition to \"real\"; on the con-\n\ntrary, the reality of the creative, or the placing-in-continuous variation of\n\nvariables, is in opposition only to the actual determination of their con-\n\nstant relations. Each time we draw a line of variation, the variables are of a\n\nparticular nature (phonological, syntactical or grammatical, semantic, and\n\nso on), but the line itself is apertinent, asyntactic or agrammatical,\n\nasemantic. Agrammaticality, for example, is no longer a contingent char-\n\nacteristic of speech opposed to the grammaticality of language; rather, it is\n\nthe ideal characteristic of a line placing grammatical variables in a state of\n\ncontinuous variation. Let us take Nicolas Ruwet's examples of certain sin-\n\ngular expressions of Cummings's: \"he danced his did,\" or \"they went their\n\ncame.\" It is possible to reconstitute the variations through which the gram-\n\nmatical variables pass in virtuality in order to end up as agrammatical\n\nexpressions of this kind (\"he did his dance,\" \"he danced his dance,\" \"he\n\ndanced what he did,\"...; \"they went as they came,\" \"they went their way,\"\n\n.. .).\n\n34\n\nIn spite of Ruwet's structural interpretation, we should avoid taking\n\nthe view that the atypical expression is produced by the successive correct\n\nforms. It is instead the atypical expression that produces the\n\nplacing-in-variation of the correct forms, uprooting them from their state\n\nas constants. The atypical expression constitutes a cutting edge of\n\ndeterritorialization of language, it plays the role _of tensor; _in other\nwords, it\n\ncauses language to tend toward the limit of its elements, forms, or notions,\n\ntoward a near side or a beyond of language. The tensor effects a kind of\n\ntransitivization of the phrase, causing the last term to react upon the pre-\n\nceding term, back through the entire chain. It assures an intensive and\n\nchromatic treatment of language. An expression as simple as AND . . . can\n\nplay the role of tensor for all of language.

That is because they wish to define the abstract machine by con-\n\nstants that can be modified only secondarily, by a cumulative effect or\n\nsyntagmatic mutation. But the abstract machine of language is not univer-\n\nsal, or even general, but singular; it is not actual, but virtual-real; it\nhas, not\n\ninvariable or obligatory rules, but optional rules that ceaselessly vary with\n\nthe variation itself, as in a game in which each move changes the rules. That\n\nis why abstract machines and assemblages of enunciation are complemen-\n\ntary, and present in each other. The abstract machine is like the diagram of\n\nan assemblage. It draws lines of continuous variation, while the concrete\n\nassemblage treats variables and organized their highly diverse relations as a\n\nfunction of those lines. The assemblage negotiates variables at this or that\n\nlevel of variation, according to this or that degree of deterritorialization,\n\nand determines which variables will enter into constant relations or obey\n\nobligatory rules and which will serve instead as a fluid matter for variation.\n\nWe should not conclude from this that the assemblage brings only a certain\n\nresistance or inertia to bear against the abstract machine; for even \"con-\n\nstants\" are essential to the determination of the virtualities through which\n\nthe variation passes, they are themselves optionally chosen. There is\n\nindeed braking and resistance at a certain level, but at another level of the\n\nassemblage there is nothing but a come-and-go between different types of\n\nvariables, and corridors of passage traveled in both directions: the varia-\n\nbles effectuate the machine in unison, in the sum of their relations. There is\n\ntherefore no basis for a distinction between a constant and collective lan-\n\nguage, and variable and individual speech acts. The abstract machine is\n\nalways singular, designated by the proper mane of a group or individual,\n\nwhile the assemblage of enunciation is always collective, in the individual\n\nas in the group. The Lenin abstract machine, and the Bolshevik collective\n\nassemblage .. . The same goes for literature, for music. There is no primacy\n\nof the individual; there is instead an indissolubility of a singular Abstract\n\nand a collective Concrete. The abstract machine does not exist indepen-\n\ndently of the assemblage, any more than the assemblage functions inde-\n\npendently of the machine.\n\n**IV. \"Language Can Be Scientifically Studied Only under the Conditions **\n\n**of a Standard or Major Language\"**\n\nSince everybody knows that language is a heterogeneous, variable reality, what\n\nis the meaning of the linguists' insistence on carving out a homoge-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)122.png)\n\n0\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS \u25a1 101\n\nneous system in order to make a scientific study possible?

Linguistics can claim all it wants to be science,\n\nnothing but pure science\u2014it wouldn't be the first time that the order of\n\npure science was used to secure the requirements of another order.

There is no mother\n\ntongue, only a power takeover by a dominant language that at times\n\nadvances along a broad front, and at times swoops down on diverse centers\n\nsimultaneously.

According to Malmberg, it is rare to find\n\nclear boundaries on dialect maps; instead, there are transitional and\n\nlimitrophe zones, zones of indiscernibility. It is also said that \"the\n\nQuebecois language is so rich in modulations and variations of regional\n\naccents and in games with tonic accents that it sometimes seems, with no\n\nexaggeration, that it would be better preserved by musical notation than by\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)123.png)\n\n0\n\n102 \u25a1\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\nany system of spelling.\"\n\n37\n\nThe very notion of dialect is quite questionable.\n\nMoreover, it is relative because one needs to know in relation to what major\n\nlanguage it exercises its function: for example, the Quebecois language\n\nmust be evaluated not only in relation to standard French but also in rela-\n\ntion to major English, from which it borrows all kinds of phonetic and syn-\n\ntactical elements, in order to set them in variation. The Bantu dialects\n\nmust be evaluated not only in relation to the mother tongue but also in rela-\n\ntion to Afrikaans as a major language, and English as a counter-major lan-\n\nguage preferred by blacks.\n\n38\n\nIn short, the notion of dialect does not\n\nelucidate that of minor language, but the other way around; it is the minor\n\nlanguage that defines dialects through its own possibilities for variation.\n\nShould we identify major and minor languages on the basis of regional situ-\n\nations of bilingualism or multilingualism including at least one dominant\n\nlanguage and one dominated language, or a world situation giving certain\n\nlanguages an imperialist power over others (for example, the role of Ameri-\n\ncan English today)?\n\nAt least two things prevent us from adopting this point of view. As\n\nChomsky notes, a dialect, ghetto language, or minor language is not\n\nimmune to the kind of treatment that draws a homogeneous system from it\n\nand extracts constants: Black English has its own grammar, which is not\n\ndefined by a sum of mistakes or infractions against standard English; but\n\nthat grammar can be studied only by applying to it the same rules of study\n\nthat are applied to standard English. In this sense, the notions of major and\n\nminor seem to have no linguistic relevance. When French lost its world-\n\nwide major function it lost nothing of its constancy and homogeneity, its\n\ncentralization. Conversely, Afrikaans attained homogeneity when it was a\n\nlocally minor language struggling against English. Even politically, espe-\n\ncially politically, it is difficult to see how the upholders of a minor\nlanguage\n\ncan operate if not by giving it (if only by writing in it) a constancy and\n\nhomogeneity making it a locally major language capable of forcing official\n\nrecognition (hence the political role of writers who assert the rights of a\n\nminor language). But the opposite argument seems more compelling: the\n\nmore a language has or acquires the characteristics of a major language, the\n\nmore it is affected by continuous variations that transpose it into a\n\n\"minor\" language. It is futile to criticize the worldwide imperialism of a\n\nlanguage by denouncing the corruptions it introduces into other languages\n\n(for example, the purists' criticisms of English influences in French, the\n\npetit-bourgeois or academic denunciation of \"Franglais\"). For if a lan-\n\nguage such as British English or American English is major on a world\n\nscale, it is necessarily worked upon by all the minorities of the world, using\n\nvery diverse procedures of variation. Take the way Gaelic and Irish English\n\nset English in variation.

(Furthermore, American\n\nEnglish could not have _constituted _itself without this linguistic labor of\nthe\n\nminorities.) Or the linguistic situation in the old Austrian empire: German\n\nwas a major language in relation to the minorities, but as such it could not\n\navoid being treated by those minorities in a way that made it a minor\n\nlanguage in relation to the German of the Germans. There is no language\n\nthat does not have intralinguistic, endogenous, internal minorities. So at\n\nthe most general level of linguistics, Chomsky's and Labov's positions are\n\nconstantly passing and converting into each other. Chomsky can say that\n\neven a minor, dialectical, or ghetto language cannot be studied unless\n\ninvariants are extracted from it and \"extrinsic or mixed\" variables are\n\neliminated; and Labov can respond that even a standard or major language\n\ncannot be studied independently of \"inherent\" variations, which are pre-\n\ncisely neither mixed nor extrinsic. _You will never find a homogeneous sys-  \ntem that is not still or already affected by a regulated, continuous, immanent  \nprocess of variation _(why does Chomsky pretend not to understand this?).\n\nThere are not, therefore, two kinds of languages but two possible treat-\n\nments of the same language. Either the variables are treated in such a way\n\nas to extract from them constants and constant relations or in such a way as\n\nto place them in continuous variation. We were wrong to give the impres-\n\nsion at times that constants existed alongside variables, linguistic con-\n\nstants alongside variables of enunciation: that was only for convenience of\n\npresentation. For it is obvious that the constants are drawn from the varia-\n\nbles themselves; universals in linguistics have no more existence in them-\n\nselves than they do in economics and are always concluded from a\n\nuniversalization or a rendering-uniform involving variables. _Constant is  \nnot opposed to variable; _it is a treatment of the variable opposed to the\nother\n\nkind of treatment, or continuous variation. So-called obligatory rules cor-\n\nrespond to the first kind of treatment, whereas optional rules concern the\n\nconstruction of a continuum of variation. Moreover, there are a certain\n\nnumber of categories or distinctions that cannot be invoked, that are inap-\n\nplicable and useless as a basis for objections because they presuppose the\n\nfirst treatment and are entirely subordinated to the quest for constants: for\n\nexample, language as opposed to speech; synchrony as opposed to\n\ndiachrony; competence as opposed to performance; distinctive features as\n\nopposed to nondistinctive (or secondarily distinctive) features. For\n\nnondistinctive features, whether prosodic, stylistic, or pragmatic, are not\n\nonly omnipresent variables, in contrast to the presence or absence of a con-\n\nstant; they are not only superlinear and \"suprasegmental\" elements, in\n\ncontrast to linear segmental elements; their very characteristics give them\n\nthe power to place all the elements of language in a state of continuous\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)125.png)\n\n0\n\n104 \u25a1\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\nvariation\u2014for example, the impact of tone on phonemes, accent on mor-\n\nphemes, or intonation on syntax. These are not secondary features but\n\nanother treatment of language that no longer operates according to the pre-\n\nceding categories.\n\n\"Major\" and \"minor\" do not qualify two different languages but rather\n\ntwo usages or functions of language. Bilingualism, of course, provides a\n\ngood example, but once again we use it simply for the sake of convenience.\n\nDoubtless, in the Austrian empire Czech was a minor language in relation\n\nto German; but the German of Prague already functioned as a potentially\n\nminor language in relation to the German of Vienna or Berlin; and Kafka, a\n\nCzechoslovakian Jew writing in German, submits German to creative\n\ntreatment as a minor language, constructing a continuum of variation,\n\nnegotiating all of the variables both to constrict the constants and to\n\nexpand the variables: make language stammer, or make it \"wail,\" stretch\n\ntensors through all of language, even written language, and draw from it\n\ncries, shouts, pitches, durations, timbres, accents, intensities. Two con-\n\njoined tendencies in so-called minor languages have often been noted: an\n\nimpoverishment, a shedding of syntactical and lexical forms; but simulta-\n\nneously a strange proliferation of shifting effects, a taste for overload and\n\nparaphrase. This applies to the German of Prague, Black English, and\n\nQuebecois. But with rare exceptions, the interpretation of the linguists has\n\nbeen rather malevolent, invoking a consubstantial poverty and preciosity.\n\nThe alleged poverty is in fact a restriction of constants and the overload an\n\nextension of variations functioning to deploy a continuum sweeping up all\n\ncomponents. The poverty is not a lack but a void or ellipsis allowing one to\n\nsidestep a constant instead of tackling it head on, or to approach it from\n\nabove or below instead of positioning oneself within it. And the overload is\n\nnot a rhetorical figure, a metaphor, or symbolic structure; it is a mobile\npar-\n\naphrase bearing witness to the unlocalized presence of an indirect dis-\n\ncourse at the heart of every statement. From both sides we see a rejection of\n\nreference points, a dissolution of constant form in favor of differences in\n\ndynamic. The closer a language gets to this state, the closer it comes not\n\nonly to a system of musical notation, but also to music itself.\n\n39\n\nSubtract and place in variation, remove and place in variation: a single\n\noperation. Minor languages are characterized not by overload and poverty\n\nin relation to a standard or major language, but by a sobriety and variation\n\nthat are like a minor treatment of the standard language, a\n\nbecoming-minor of the major language. The problem is not the\n\ndistinction between major and minor language; it is one of a becoming. It\n\nis a question not of reterritorializing oneself on a dialect or a patois but\nof\n\ndeterritorializing the major language.

Minor languages do not exist in themselves: they exist only in rela-\n\ntion to a major language and are also investments of that language for the\n\npurpose of making it minor. One must find the minor language, the dialect\n\nor rather idiolect, on the basis of which one can make one's own major lan-\n\nguage minor. That is the strength of authors termed \"minor,\" who are in\n\nfact the greatest, the only greats: having to conquer one's own language, in\n\nother words, to attain that sobriety in the use of a major language, in order\n\nto place it in a state of continuous variation (the opposite of regionalism).\nIt\n\nis in one's own language that one is bilingual or multilingual. Conquer the\n\nmajor language in order to delineate in it as yet unknown minor languages.\n\nUse the minor language to _send the major language racing. _Minor authors\n\nare foreigners in their own tongue. If they are bastards, if they experience\n\nthemselves as bastards, it is due not to a mixing or intermingling of lan-\n\nguages but rather to a subtraction and variation of their own language\n\nachieved by stretching tensors through it.\n\nThe notion _of minority _is very complex, with musical, literary, linguis-\n\ntic, as well as juridical and political, references. The opposition between\n\nminority and majority is not simply quantitative. Majority implies a con-\n\nstant, of expression or content, serving as a standard measure by which to\n\nevaluate it. Let us suppose that the constant or standard is the average\n\nadult-white-heterosexual-European-male-speaking a standard language\n\n(Joyce's or Ezra Pound's Ulysses). It is obvious that \"man\" holds the\n\nmajority, even if he is less numerous than mosquitoes, children, women,\n\nblacks, peasants, homosexuals, etc. That is because he appears twice, once\n\nin the constant and again in the variable from which the constant is\n\nextracted. Majority assumes a state of power and domination, not the other\n\nway around. It assumes the standard measure, not the other way around.\n\nEven Marxism \"has almost always translated hegemony from the point of\n\nview of the national worker, qualified, male and over thirty-five.\"\n\n40\n\nA\n\ndetermination different from that of the constant will therefore be consid-\n\nered minoritarian, by nature and regardless of number, in other words, a\n\nsubsystem or an outsystem. This is evident in all the operations, electoral\n\nor otherwise, where you are given a choice, but on the condition that your\n\nchoice conform to the limits of the constant (\"you mustn't choose to\n\nchange society...\"). But at this point, everything is reversed. For the\n\nmajority, insofar as it is analytically included in the abstract standard, is\n\nnever anybody, it is always Nobody\u2014Ulysses\u2014whereas the minority is\n\nthe becoming of everybody, one's potential becoming to the extent that one\n\ndeviates from the model. There is a majoritarian \"fact,\" but it is the ana-\n\nlytic fact of Nobody, as opposed to the becoming-minoritarian of every-\n\nbody.

The problem\n\nis never to acquire the majority, even in order to install a new constant.\n\nThere is no becoming-majoritarian; majority is never becoming. All\n\nbecoming is minoritarian. Women, regardless of their numbers, are a\n\nminority, definable as a state or subset; but they create only by making pos-\n\nsible a becoming over which they do not have ownership, into which they\n\nthemselves must enter; this is a becoming-woman affecting all of human-\n\nkind, men and women both. The same goes for minor languages: they are\n\nnot simply sublanguages, idiolects or dialects, but potential agents of the\n\nmajor language's entering into a becoming-minoritarian of all of its dimen-\n\nsions and elements. We should distinguish between minor languages, the\n\nmajor language, and the becoming-minor of the major language. Minori-\n\nties, of course, are objectively definable states, states of language,\nethnicity,\n\nor sex with their own ghetto territorialities, but they must also be thought\n\nof as seeds, crystals of becoming whose value is to trigger uncontrollable\n\nmovements and deterritorializations of the mean or majority. That is why\n\nPasolini demonstrated that the essential thing, precisely in free indirect\n\ndiscourse, is to be found neither in language A, nor in language B, but \"in\n\nlanguage X, which is none other than language A in the actual process of\n\nbecoming language B.\"\n\n41\n\nThere is a universal figure of minoritarian con-\n\nsciousness as the becoming of everybody, and that becoming is creation.\n\nOne does not attain it by acquiring the majority. The figure to which we are\n\nreferring is continuous variation, as an amplitude that continually over-\n\nsteps the representative threshold of the majoritarian standard, by excess\n\nor default. In erecting the figure of a universal minoritarian consciousness,\n\none addresses powers _(puissances) _of becoming that belong to a different\n\nrealm from that of Power _(Pouvoir) _and Domination. Continuous variation\n\nconstitutes the becoming-minoritarian of everybody, as opposed to the\n\nmajoritarian Fact of Nobody. Becoming-minoritarian as the universal fig-\n\nure of consciousness is called autonomy. It is certainly not by using a minor\n\nlanguage as a dialect, by regionalizing or ghettoizing, that one becomes\n\nrevolutionary; rather, by using a number of minority elements, by connect-\n\ning, conjugating them, one invents a specific, unforeseen, autonomous be-\n\ncoming.\n\n42\n\nThe major and minor mode are two different treatments of language,\n\none of which consists in extracting constants from it, the other in placing it\n\nin continuous variation.

Following\n\nCanetti's suggestions, we may begin from the following pragmatic situa-\n\ntion: the order-word is a death sentence; it always implies a death sentence,\n\neven if it has been considerably softened, becoming symbolic, initiatory,\n\ntemporary, etc. Order-words bring immediate death to those who receive\n\nthe order, or potential death if they do not obey, or a death they must them-\n\nselves inflict, take elsewhere. A father's orders to his son, \"You will do\n\nthis,\" \"You will not do that,\" cannot be separated from the little death sen-\n\ntence the son experiences on a point of his person. Death, death; it is the\n\nonly judgment, and it is what makes judgment a system. The verdict. _But  \nthe order-word is also something else, _inseparably connected: it is like a\n\nwarning cry or a message to flee. It would be oversimplifying to say that\n\nflight is a reaction against the order-word; rather, it is included in it, as\nits\n\nother face in a complex assemblage, its other component. Canetti is right to\n\ninvoke the lion's roar, which enunciates flight and death simultaneously.\n\n43\n\nThe order-word has two tones. The prophet receives order-words just as\n\nmuch in taking flight as in longing for death: Jewish prophetism fused the\n\nwish to be dead and the flight impulse with the divine order-word.\n\nNow if we consider the first aspect of the order-word, in other words,\n\ndeath as the expressed of the statement, it clearly meets the preceding\n\nrequirements: even though death essentially concerns bodies, is attributed\n\nto bodies, its immediacy, its instantaneousness, lends it the authentic char-\n\nacter of an incorporeal transformation. What precedes and follows it may\n\nbe an extensive system of actions and passions, a slow labor of bodies; in\n\nitself, it is neither action nor passion, but a pure act, a pure\ntransformation\n\nthat enunciation fuses with the statement, the sentence. That man is dead\n\n... You are already dead when you receive the order-word ... In effect,\n\ndeath is everywhere, as that ideal, uncrossable boundary separating bod-\n\nies, their forms, and states, and as the condition, even initiatory, even sym-\n\nbolic, through which a subject must pass in order to change its form or\n\nstate. This is the sense in which Canetti speaks of \"enantiomorphosis\":\n\n44\n\na\n\nregime that involves a hieratic and immutable Master who at every\n\nmoment legislates by constants, prohibiting or strictly limiting metamor-\n\nphoses, giving figures clear and stable contours, setting forms in opposi-\n\ntion two by two and requiring subjects to die in order to pass from one form\n\nto the other. It is always by means of something incorporeal that a body sep-\n\narates and distinguishes itself from another. The figure, insofar as it is the\n\nextremity of a body, is the noncorporeal attribute that limits and completes\n\nthat body: death is the Figure. It is through death that a body reaches com-\n\npletion not only in time but in space, and it is through death that its lines\n\nform or outline a shape. There are dead spaces just as there are dead times.\n\n\"If [enantiomorphosis is] practiced often the whole world shrivels....\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)129.png)\n\n0\n\n108 \u25a1\n\nNOVEMBER 20, 1923: POSTULATES OF LINGUISTICS\n\nSocial prohibitions against metamorphosis are perhaps the most impor-\n\ntant of all. . . . Death itself, the strictest of all boundaries, is what is\ninter-\n\nposed between classes.\"\n\n45\n\nIn a regime of this kind, any new body requires\n\nthe erection of an opposable form, as well as the formation of distinct sub-\n\njects; death is the general incorporeal transformation attributed to all bod-\n\nies from the standpoint of their forms and substances (for example, the\n\nbody of the Party cannot come into its own without an operation of\n\nenantiomorphosis, and without the formation of new activists, which\n\nassumes the elimination of the first generation).\n\nIt is true that we are bringing in considerations of content as well as\n\nexpression. For even at the moment when the two planes are most distinct,\n\nas the regime of bodies and the regime of signs in an assemblage, they are\n\nstill in reciprocal presupposition. The incorporeal transformation is the\n\nexpressed of order-words, but also the attribute of bodies. Not only do lin-\n\nguistic variables of expression enter into relations of formal opposition or\n\ndistinction favorable to the extraction of constants; nonlinguistic variables\n\nof content do also. As Hjelmslev notes, an expression is divided, for exam-\n\nple, into phonic units in the same way a content is divided into social, zoo-\n\nlogical, or physical units (\"calf divides into young-bovine-male).\n\n46\n\nThe\n\nnetwork of binarities, or arborescences, is applicable to both sides. There\n\nis, however, no analytic resemblance, correspondence, or conformity\n\nbetween the two planes. But their independence does not preclude isomor-\n\nphism, in other words, the existence of the same kind of constant relations\n\non both sides. It is by virtue of this type of relations that linguistic and\n\nnonlinguistic elements are inseparable from the start, despite their absence\n\nof correspondence. The elements of content give the interminglings of bod-\n\nies clear contours at the same time as the elements of expression give the\n\nnoncorporeal expresseds a power of sentencing or judgment. These ele-\n\nments are all abstract or deterritorialized to different degrees, but in each\n\ninstance they effect a reterritorialization of the overall assemblage on cer-\n\ntain order-words and contours. Indeed, the significance of the doctrine of\n\nsynthetic judgment is to have demonstrated that there is an a priori link\n\n(isomorphism) between Sentence and Figure, form of expression and form\n\nof content.\n\nIf we consider the other aspect of the order-word, flight rather than\n\ndeath, it appears that variables are in a new state, that of continuous varia-\n\ntion.

We\n\nwitness the incorporeal power of that intense matter, the material power of\n\nthat language. A matter more immediate, more fluid, and more ardent than\n\nbodies or words. In continuous variation the relevant distinction is no\n\nlonger between a form of expression and a form of content but between\n\ntwo inseparable planes in reciprocal presupposition.

Absolute, however, does not mean undifferentiated:\n\ndifferences, now \"infinitely small,\" are constituted in a single matter\n\nserving both for expression as incorporeal power and for content as\n\nlimitless corporeality. The relation of presupposition between variables of\n\ncontent and expression no longer requires two forms: the\n\nplacing-in-variation of the variables instead draws the two forms together\n\nand effects the conjunction of cutting edges of deterritorialization on both\n\nsides; this occurs on the plane of a single liberated matter that contains no\n\nfigures, is deliberately unformed, and retains in expression and in content\n\nonly those cutting edges, tensors, and tensions.

Thus it is the study of the signifying regime that first testifies\nto\n\nthe inadequacy of linguistic presuppositions, and in the very name of\n\nregimes of signs.\n\nThere is a simple general formula for the signifying regime of the sign\n\n(the signifying sign): every sign refers to another sign, and only to another\n\nsign, ad infinitum. That is why, at the limit, one can forgo the notion of the\n\nsign, for what is retained is not principally the sign's relation to a state\nof\n\nthings it designates, or to an entity it signifies, but only the formal\nrelation\n\nof sign to sign insofar as it defines a so-called signifying chain. The\n\nlimitlessness of signifiance replaces the sign. When denotation (here, des-\n\nignation and signification taken together) is assumed to be part of connota-\n\ntion, one is wholly within this signifying regime of the sign. Not much\n\nattention is paid to _indexes, _in other words, the territorial states of\nthings\n\nconstituting the designatable. Not much attention is paid to _icons, _that is,\n\noperations of reterritorialization constituting the signifiable. Thus the sign\n\nhas already attained a high degree of relative deterritorialization; it is\n\nthought of as a _symbol _in a constant movement of referral from sign to sign.\n\nThe signifier is the sign in redundancy with the sign. All signs are signs of\n\nsigns. The question is not yet what a given sign signifies but to which other\n\nsigns it refers, or which signs add themselves to it to form a network with-\n\nout beginning or end that projects its shadow onto an amorphous atmo-\n\nspheric continuum. It is this amorphous continuum that for the moment\n\nplays the role of the \"signified,\" but it continually glides beneath the\n\nsignifier, for which it serves only as a medium or wall: the specific forms of\n\nall contents dissolve in it. The atmospherization or mundanization of con-\n\ntents. Contents are abstracted. This is the situation Levi-Strauss describes:\n\nthe world begins to signify before anyone knows _what _it signifies; the\nsigni-\n\nfied is given without being known.\n\n1\n\nYour wife looked at you with a funny\n\nexpression.

It doesn't mat-\n\nter what it means, it's still signifying. The sign that refers to other signs\nis\n\nstruck with a strange impotence and uncertainty, but mighty is the signifier\n\nthat constitutes the chain. The paranoiac shares this impotence of the\n\ndeterritorialized sign assailing him from every direction in the gliding\n\natmosphere, but that only gives him better access to the superpower of the\n\nsignifier, through the royal feeling of wrath, as master of the network\n\nspreading through the atmosphere.

It's made for\n\nthat, it's the tragic regime of infinite debt, to which one is simultaneously\n\ndebtor and creditor. A sign refers to another sign, into which it passes and\n\nwhich carries it into still other signs. \"To the point that it returns in a\ncircu-\n\nlar fashion ...\" Not only do signs form an infinite network, but the net-\n\nwork of signs is infinitely circular. The statement survives its object, the\n\nname survives its owner. Whether it passes into other signs or is kept in\n\nreserve for a time, the sign survives both its state of things and its\nsignified;\n\nit leaps like an animal or a dead person to regain its place in the chain and\n\ninvest a new state, a new signified, from which it will in turn extricate\n\nitself.\n\n2\n\nA hint of the eternal return. There is a whole regime of roving, float-\n\ning statements, suspended names, signs lying in wait to return and be\n\npropelled by the chain. The signifier as the self-redundancy of the\n\ndeterri-torialized sign, a funereal world of terror.\n\nBut what counts is less this circularity of signs than the multiplicity of\n\nthe circles or chains. The sign refers not only to other signs in the same\ncir-\n\ncle, but to signs in other circles or spirals as well. Robert Lowie describes\n\nhow Crow and Hopi men react differently when their wives cheat on them\n\n(the Crow are nomadic hunters and the Hopi sedentaries with an imperial\n\ntradition): \"A Crow Indian whose wife has cheated on him slashes her face,\n\nwhereas the Hopi who has fallen victim to the same misfortune, without\n\nlosing his calm, withdraws and prays for drought and famine to descend on\n\nthe village.\" It is easy to see where the paranoia resides, the despotic ele-\n\nment or signifying regime, or again, as Levi-Strauss says, \"the bigotry\": \"In\n\neffect, for a Hopi everything is connected: a social disturbance or a domes-\n\ntic incident calls into question the system of the universe, the levels of\n\nwhich are united by multiple correspondences; a disruption on one plane is\n\nonly intelligible, and morally tolerable, as a projection of other disruptions\n\ninvolving other levels.\"\n\n3\n\nThe Hopi jump from one circle to another, or from\n\none sign to another on a different spiral. One leaves the village or the city,\n\nonly to return. The jumps may be regulated not only by presignifying ritu-\n\nals but also by a whole imperial bureaucracy passing judgment on their\n\nlegitimacy. The jumps are not made at random, they are not without rules.\n\nNot only are they regulated, but some are prohibited: Do not overstep the\n\noutermost circle, do not approach the innermost circle .. . There is a dis-\n\ntinction between circles because, although all signs refer to each other only\n\nto the extent that they are deterritorialized, oriented toward the same cen-\n\nter of signifiance, distributed throughout an amorphous continuum, they\n\nhave different speeds of deterritorialization attesting to a place of origin\n\n(temple, palace, house, street, village, bush, etc.), and they have\ndifferential\n\nrelations maintaining the distinction between circles or constituting\n\nthresholds in the atmosphere of the continuum (private and public, family\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)135.png)\n\n0\n\n114 \u25a1\n\n587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\nincident and social disorder). Moreover, the distribution of these thresh-\n\nolds and circles changes according to the case. Deception is fundamental to\n\nthe system. Jumping from circle to circle, always moving the scene, playing\n\nit out somewhere else: such is the hysteric operation of the deceiver as sub-\n\nject, answering to the paranoid operation of the despot installed in his cen-\n\nter of signifiance.\n\nThere is one other aspect: the signifying regime is not simply faced with\n\nthe task of organizing into circles signs emitted from every direction; it\n\nmust constantly assure the expansion of the circles or spiral, it must pro-\n\nvide the center with more signifier to overcome the entropy inherent in the\n\nsystem and to make new circles blossom or replenish the old. Thus a secon-\n\ndary mechanism in the service of signifiance is necessary: interpretance or\n\ninterpretation. This time the signifier assumes a new figure: it is no longer\n\nthe amorphous continuum that is given without being known and across\n\nwhich the network of signs is strung. A portion of signified is made to corre-\n\nspond to a sign or group of signs for which that signified has been deemed\n\nsuitable, thus making it knowable. To the syntagmatic axis of the sign refer-\n\nring to other signs is added a paradigmatic axis on which the sign, thus for-\n\nmalized, fashions for itself a suitable signified (once again there is\n\nabstraction of the content, but in a new way). The interpretive priest, the\n\nseer, is one of the despot-god's bureaucrats. A new aspect of deception\n\narises, the deception of the priest: interpretation is carried to infinity and\n\nnever encounters anything to interpret that is not already itself an interpre-\n\ntation. The signified constantly reimparts signifier, recharges it or pro-\n\nduces more of it. The form always comes from the signifier. The ultimate\n\nsignified is therefore the signifier itself, in its redundancy or \"excess.\" It\nis\n\nperfectly futile to claim to transcend interpretation or even communica-\n\ntion through the production of signifier, because communication and\n\ninterpretation are what always serve to reproduce and produce signifier.\n\nThat is certainly not the way to revive the notion of production. The dis-\n\ncovery of the psychoanalyst-priests (a discovery every kind of priest or seer\n\nmade in their time) was that interpretation had to be subordinated to\n\nsignifiance, to the point that the signifier would impart no signified with-\n\nout the signified reimparting signifier in its turn. Actually, there is no\n\nlonger even any need to interpret, but that is because the best interpreta-\n\ntion, the weightiest and most radical one, is an eminently significant\n\nsilence. It is well known that although psychoanalysts have ceased to speak,\n\nthey interpret even more, or better yet, fuel interpretation on the part of\nthe\n\nsubject, who jumps from one circle of hell to the next. In truth, signifiance\n\nand interpretosis are the two diseases of the earth or the skin, in other\n\nwords, humankind's fundamental neurosis.\n\nThere is not much to say about the center of signifiance, or the Signifier\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)136.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 115\n\nin person, because it is a pure abstraction no less than a pure principle; in\n\nother words, it is nothing. Lack or excess, it hardly matters. It comes to the\n\nsame thing to say that the sign refers to other signs ad infinitum and that\nthe\n\ninfinite set of all signs refers to a supreme signifier. At any rate, this\npure\n\nformal redundancy of the signifier could not even be conceptualized if it\n\ndid not have its own substance of expression, for which we must find a\n\nname: _faciality. _Not only is language always accompanied by faciality\n\ntraits, but the face crystallizes all redundancies, it emits and receives,\n\nreleases and recaptures signifying signs. It is a whole body unto itself: it\nis\n\nlike the body of the center of signifiance to which all of the\ndeterritorialized\n\nsigns affix themselves, and it marks the limit of their deterritorialization.\n\nThe voice emanates from the face; that is why, however fundamentally\n\nimportant the writing machine is in the imperial bureaucracy, what is writ-\n\nten retains an oral or nonbook character. The face is the Icon proper to the\n\nsignifying regime, the reterritorialization internal to the system. The\n\nsignifier reterritorializes on the face. The face is what gives the signifier\n\nsubstance; it is what fuels interpretation, and it is what changes, changes\n\ntraits, when interpretation reimparts signifier to its substance. Look, his\n\nexpression changed. The signifier is always facialized. Faciality reigns\n\nmaterially over that whole constellation of signifiances and interpretations\n\n(psychologists have written extensively on the baby's relations to the moth-\n\ner's face, and sociologists on the role of the face in mass media and adver-\n\ntising). The despot-god has never hidden his face, far from it: he makes\n\nhimself one, or even several. The mask does not hide the face, it _is _the\nface.\n\nThe priest administers the face of the god. With the despot, everything is\n\npublic, and everything that is public is so by virtue of the face. Lies and\n\ndeception may be a fundamental part of the signifying regime, but secrecy\n\nis not.\n\n4\n\nConversely, when the face is effaced, when the faciality traits dis-\n\nappear, we can be sure that we have entered another regime, other zones\n\ninfinitely muter and more imperceptible where subterranean\n\nbecomings-animal occur, becomings-molecular, nocturnal\n\ndeterritorializations over-spilling the limits of the signifying system. The\n\ndespot or god brandishes the solar face that is his entire body, as the body\n\nof the signifier. He looked at me queerly, he knitted his brow, what did I\n\ndo to make him change expression? I have her picture in front of me, it's as\n\nif she were watching me ... Surveillance by the face, as Strindberg said.\n\nOvercoding by the signifier, irradiation in all directions, unlocalized\n\nomnipresence.\n\nFinally, the face or body of the despot or god has something like a\n\ncounterbody: the body of the tortured, or better, of the excluded. There is\n\nno question that these two bodies communicate, for the body of the despot\n\nis sometimes subjected to trials of humiliation or even torture, or of exile\n\nand exclusion. \"At the opposite pole one might imagine placing the body of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)137.png)\n\n1\n\n16 \u25a1 587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\nthe condemned man; he, too, has his legal status; he gives rise to his own\n\nceremonial... not in order to ground the surplus power possessed by the\n\nperson of the sovereign, but in order to code the lack of power with which\n\nthose subjected to punishment are marked.

He tortured himself, gouged out\n\nhis own eyes, then went away. The rite, the becoming-animal of the scape-\n\ngoat clearly illustrates this: a first expiatory animal is sacrificed, but a\nsec-\n\nond is driven away, sent out into the desert wilderness. In the signifying\n\nregime, the scapegoat represents a new form of increasing entropy in the\n\nsystem of signs: it is charged with everything that was \"bad\" in a given\n\nperiod, that is, everything that resisted signifying signs, everything that\n\neluded the referral from sign to sign through the different circles; it also\n\nassumes everything that was unable to recharge the signifier at its center\n\nand carries off everything that spills beyond the outermost circle. Finally,\n\nand especially, it incarnates that line of flight the signifying regime cannot\n\ntolerate, in other words, an absolute deterritorialization; the regime must\n\nblock a line of this kind or define it in an entirely negative fashion\nprecisely\n\nbecause it exceeds the degree of deterritorialization of the signifying sign,\n\nhowever high it may be. The line of flight is like a tangent to the circles of\n\nsignifiance and the center of the signifier. It is under a curse. The goat's\n\nanus stands opposite the face of the despot or god. Anything that threatens\n\nto put the system to flight will be killed or put to flight itself. Anything\nthat\n\nexceeds the excess of the signifier or passes beneath it will be marked with a\n\nnegative value. Your only choice will be between a goat's ass and the face of\n\nthe god, between sorcerers and priests.

This excessively hasty overview is applicable not only to the\n\nimperial despotic regime but to all subjected, arborescent, hierarchical,\n\ncentered groups: political parties, literary movements, psychoanalytic\n\nassociations, families, conjugal units, etc. The photo, faciality, redun-\n\ndancy, signifiance, and interpretation are at work everywhere.

We would like to indicate very briefly certain characteristics of the\n\nother two semiotic systems. First, the so-called primitive, _presignifying  \nsemiotic, _which is much closer to \"natural\" codings operating without\n\nsigns. There is no reduction to faciality as the sole substance of expression:\n\nthere is no elimination of forms of content through abstraction of the signi-\n\nfied. To the extent that there is still abstraction of content from a strictly\n\nsemiotic point of view, it fosters a pluralism or polyvocality of forms of\n\nexpression that prevents any power takeover by the signifier and preserves\n\nexpressive forms particular to content; thus forms of corporeality,\n\ngesturality, rhythm, dance, and rite coexist heterogeneously with the vocal\n\nform.\n\n6\n\nA variety of forms and substances of expression intersect and form\n\nrelays. It is a segmentary but plurilinear, multidimensional semiotic that\n\nwards off any kind of signifying circularity. Segmentarity is the law of the\n\nlineages. Here, the sign owes its degree of relative deterritorialization not\n\nto a perpetual referral to other signs but rather to a confrontation between\n\nthe territorialities and compared segments from which each sign is\n\nextracted (the camp, the bush, the moving of the camp).

On the contrary, it is animated\nby\n\na keen presentiment of what is to come. It does not need to understand it to\n\nfight against it. It is wholly destined by its very segmentarity and\n\npoly-vocality to avert the already-present threat: universalizing\n\nabstraction, erection of the signifier, circularity of statements, and their\n\ncorrelates, the State apparatus, the instatement of the despot, the priestly\n\ncaste, the scapegoat, etc. Every time they eat a dead man, they can say: one\n\nmore the State won't get.\n\nThere is another semiotic, the _countersignifying _semiotic (whose most\n\nnotable representatives are the fearsome, warlike, and animal-raising\n\nnomads, as opposed to hunter nomads, who belong to the previous\n\nsemiotic).

But that was a kind of number that represented or signified, a num-\n\nber \"incited, produced, caused by something other than itself.\" On the\n\ncontrary, a numerical sign that is not produced by something outside the\n\nsystem of marking it institutes, which marks a mobile and plural distribu-\n\ntion, which itself determines functions and relations, which arrives at\n\narrangements rather than totals, distributions rather than collections,\n\nwhich operates more by breaks, transitions, migration, and accumulation\n\nthan by combining units\u2014a sign of this kind would appear to belong to the\n\nsemiotic of a nomad war machine directed against the State apparatus. The\n\nnumbering number.\n\n8\n\nIts numerical organization into tens, fifties, hun-\n\ndreds, thousands, etc., and the associated spatial organization were obvi-\n\nously adopted by State armies, but basically bear witness to a military\n\nsystem specific to the great nomads of the steppes, from the Hyksos to the\n\nMongols. They were superposed upon the principle of lineage. Secrecy and\n\nspying are important elements of the war machine's semiotic of Numbers.\n\nThe role of Numbers in the Bible is not unrelated to the nomads, since\n\nMoses got the idea from his father-in-law, Jethro the Kenite: he used it as an\n\norganizational principle for the march and migration, and applied it him-\n\nself to the military domain. In this countersignifying regime, the imperial\n\ndespotic line of flight is replaced by a line of abolition that turns back\n\nagainst the great empires, cuts across them and destroys them, or else con-\n\nquers them and integrates with them to form a mixed semiotic.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)140.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 119\n\nWe would like to go into greater detail on a fourth regime of signs, the\n\n_postsignifying _regime, which has different characteristics opposing it to\n\nsignifiance and is defined by a unique procedure, that of\n\n\"subjecti-fication.\"\n\nThere are many regimes of signs. Our own list is arbitrarily limited.\n\nThere is no reason to identify a regime or a semiotic system with a people\n\nor historical moment. There is such mixture within the same period or the\n\nsame people that we can say no more than that a given people, language,\n\nor period assures the relative dominance of a certain regime. Perhaps all\n\nsemiotics are mixed and not only combine with various forms of content\n\nbut also combine different regimes of signs. Presignifying elements are\n\nalways active in the signifying regime; countersignifying elements are\n\nalways present and at work within it; and postsignifying elements are\n\nalready there. Even that is to mark too much temporality. The semiotics\n\nand their mixtures may appear in a history of confrontation and inter-\n\nmingling of peoples, but also in languages in which there are several com-\n\npeting functions, or in a psychiatric hospital in which different forms of\n\ninsanity coexist among the patients or even combine in a single patient; or\n\nin an ordinary conversation in which people are speaking the same\n\ntongue but different languages (all of a sudden a fragment of an unex-\n\npected semiotic surfaces). We are not suggesting an evolutionism, we are\n\nnot even doing history. Semiotic systems depend on assemblages, and it is\n\nthe assemblages that determine that a given people, period, or language,\n\nand even a given style, fashion, pathology, or minuscule event in a limited\n\nsituation, can assure the predominance of one semiotic or another. We\n\nare trying to make maps of regimes of signs: we can turn them around or\n\nretain selected coordinates or dimensions, and depending on the case we\n\nwill be dealing with a social formation, a pathological delusion _(d'elire),\n_a\n\nhistorical event, etc. We will see this on another occasion when we deal\n\nwith a dated social system, \"courtly love,\" and then switch to a private\n\nenterprise called \"masochism.\" We can also combine maps or separate\n\nthem. To make the distinction between two types of semiotics (for exam-\n\nple, the postsignifying regime and the signifying regime), we must con-\n\nsider very diverse domains simultaneously.\n\nIn the first years of the twentieth century, psychiatry, at the height of its\n\nclinical skills, confronted the problem of nonhallucinatory delusions in\n\nwhich mental integrity is retained without \"intellectual diminishment.\"\n\nThere was a first major grouping, paranoid or interpretive delusions,\n\nwhich already subsumed various aspects. But the question of the possible\n\nindependence of another group was prefigured in Esquirol's monomania\n\nand Kraepelin's querulous delusion, and later defined by Serieux and\n\nCapgras as grievance delusion, and by Clerambault as passional delusion\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)141.png)\n\n0\n\n120 \u25a1\n\n587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\n(\"querulousness or seeking redress, jealousy, erotomania\"). Basing our-\n\nselves on very fine studies of Serieux and Capgras on the one hand, and\n\nClerambault on the other (the latter took the distinction furthest), we will\n\ncontrast a paranoid-interpretive ideal regime of signifiance with a\n\npassional, postsignifying subjective regime. The first regime is defined by\n\nan insidious onset and a hidden center bearing witness to endogenous\n\nforces organized around an idea; by the development of a network stretch-\n\ning across an amorphous continuum, a gliding atmosphere into which the\n\nslightest incident may be carried; by an organization of radiating circles\n\nexpanding by circular irradiation in all directions, and in which the indi-\n\nvidual jumps from one point to another, one circle to another, approaches\n\nthe center then moves away, operates prospectively and retrospectively;\n\nand by a transformation of the atmosphere, as a function of variable traits\n\nor secondary centers clustered around a principal nucleus. The second\n\nregime, on the contrary, is defined by a decisive external occurrence, by a\n\nrelation with the outside that is expressed more as an emotion than an idea,\n\nand more as effort or action than imagination (\"active delusion rather than\n\nideational delusion\"); by a limited constellation operating in a single sec-\n\ntor; by a \"postulate\" or \"concise formula\" serving as the point of departure\n\nfor a linear series or proceeding that runs its course, at which point a new\n\nproceeding begins. In short, it operates _by the linear and temporal succes-  \nsion of finite proceedings, rather than by the simultaneity of circles in\nunlim-  \nited expansion._\n\n_9_\n\nThis story of two kinds of delusions without intellectual diminishment\n\nis of great importance. For it is not a disruption of a preexisting discipline\n\nof psychiatry; it lies at the heart of the constitution of the psychiatrist in\nthe\n\nnineteenth century and explains why he or she was from the start what he\n\nor she has been ever since: the psychiatrist was born cornered, caught\n\nbetween legal, police, humanitarian demands, accused of not being a true\n\ndoctor, suspected of mistaking the sane for mad and the mad for sane, prey\n\nto quandaries of conscience, the last Hegelian _belle ame. _If we consider the\n\ntwo types of intact delusions, we can say that people in the first group seem\n\nto be completely mad, but aren't: President Schreber developed his radiat-\n\ning paranoia and relations with God in every direction, but he was not mad\n\nin that he remained capable of managing his wealth wisely and distinguish-\n\ning between circles. At the other pole are those who do not seem mad in any\n\nway, but are, as borne out by their sudden actions, such as quarrels, arsons,\n\nmurders (Esquirol's four great monomanias, erotic, intellectual, arson,\n\nand homocidal, already belong in this category). In short, psychiatry was\n\nnot at all constituted in relation to the concept of madness, or even as a\n\nmodification of that concept, but rather by _its split in these two opposite  \ndirections. _And is it not our own double image, all of ours, that psychiatry\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)142.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 121\n\nthus reveals: seeming mad withoutt&gt;eing it, then being it without seeming\n\nit? (This twofold assertion is also psychoanalysis's point of departure, its\n\nway of linking into psychiatry: we seem to be mad but aren't, observe the\n\ndream; we are mad but don't seem to be, observe everyday life.) Thus psy-\n\nchiatrists were alternately in the position of on the one hand pleading for\n\ntolerance and understanding, underscoring the uselessness of confine-\n\nment, appealing for open-door asylums; and on the other arguing for\n\nstepped-up surveillance and special high-security asylums, stricter mea-\n\nsures necessitated by the fact that the mad seemed not to be.\n\n10\n\nIs it by\n\nchance that the distinction between the two major kinds of delusions, idea-\n\ntional and active, in many ways recapitulates the distinction between the\n\nclasses (paranoiacs do not particularly need to be committed, they are usu-\n\nally bourgeois, whereas monomaniacs, passional redress-seekers, are most\n\noften from the working and rural classes, or are marginal, as in the case of\n\npolitical assassins).'' A class with radiant, irradiating ideas (but of\ncourse!)\n\nagainst a class reduced to linear, sporadic, partial, local actions ... All\npar-\n\nanoiacs are not bourgeois, all passionals or monomaniacs are not proletar-\n\nian. But God and his psychiatrists are charged with recognizing, among\n\nthese de facto mixes, those who preserve, even in delusion, the class-based\n\nsocial order, and those who sow disorder, even strictly localized, such as\n\nhaystack fires, parental murders, declasse love and aggression.\n\nWe are trying, then, to make a distinction between a paranoid, signify-\n\ning, despotic regime of signs and a passional or subjective, postsignifying,\n\nauthoritarian regime. Authoritarian is assuredly not the same as despotic,\n\npassional is not the same as paranoid, and subjective is not the same as sig-\n\nnifying. What happens in the second regime, by comparison with the signi-\n\nfying regime as we have already defined it? In the first place, _a sign or  \npacket of signs detaches from the irradiating circular network _and sets to\n\nwork on its own account, starts running a straight line, as though swept into\n\na narrow, open passage. Already the signifying system drew a line of flight\n\nor deterritorialization exceeding the specific index of its deterritorialized\n\nsigns, but the system gave that line a negative value and sent the scapegoat\n\nfleeing down it. Here, it seems that the line receives a positive sign, as\n\nthough it were effectively occupied and followed by a people who find in it\n\ntheir reason for being or destiny. Once again, we are not, of course, doing\n\nhistory: we are not saying that a people invents this regime of signs, only\n\nthat at a given moment a people effectuates the assemblage that assures the\n\nrelative dominance of that regime under certain historical conditions (and\n\nthat regime, that dominance, that assemblage may be assured under other\n\nconditions, for example, pathological, literary, romantic, or entirely mun-\n\ndane). We are not saying that a people is possessed by a given type of\n\ndelusion but that the map of a delusion, its coordinates considered, may\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)143.png)\n\n0\n\n122 \u25a1\n\n587 B.c-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\ncoincide with the map of a people, its coordinates considered. The para-\n\nnoid Pharaoh and the passional Hebrew? In the case of the Jewish people, a\n\ngroup of signs detaches from the Egyptian imperial network of which it was\n\na part and sets off down a line of flight into the desert, pitting the most\n\nauthoritarian of subjectivities against despotic signifiance, the most\n\npassional and least interpretive of delusions against interpretational\n\nparanoid delusion, in short, a linear \"proceeding and grievance\" against\n\nthe irradiating circular network. _Your grievance, your proceeding: _that is\n\nMoses' word to his people, and the proceedings come one after the other\n\nalong a line of Passion.\n\n12\n\nFrom this Kafka derives his own conception of\n\nquerulousness or the proceeding, and the succession of linear segments:\n\nthe father-proceeding, hotel-proceeding, ship-proceeding, court-pro-\n\nceeding . ..\n\nWe cannot overlook the most fundamental or extensive event in the his-\n\ntory of the Jewish people: the destruction of the Temple, in two stages (587\n\nB.C. and A.D. 70). The whole history of the Temple\u2014the mobility and fra-\n\ngility of the ark, then the construction of a House by Solomon, its recon-\n\nstruction under Darius, etc.\u2014has meaning only in relation to renewed\n\nproceedings of destruction, the two supreme moments of which came with\n\nNebuchadnezzar and Titus. A temple, mobile, fragile, or destroyed: the ark\n\nis no more than a little portable packet of signs. An entirely negative line\nof\n\nflight occupied by the animal or scapegoat laden with all the dangers\n\nthreatening the signifier has become an impossibility. Let misfortune\n\nbefall us: this formula punctuates Jewish history. It is we who must follow\n\nthe most deterritorialized line, the line of the scapegoat, but we will change\n\nits sign, we will turn it into the positive line of our subjectivity, our\nPassion,\n\nour proceeding or grievance. We will be our own scapegoat. We will be the\n\nlamb: \"The God who, like a lion, was given blood sacrifice must be shoved\n\ninto the background, and the sacrificed god must occupy the foreground.\n\n... God became the animal that was slain, instead of the animal that does\n\nthe slaying.\"\n\n13\n\nWe will follow, we will wed the tangent separating the land\n\nfrom the waters, we will separate the circular network from the gliding\n\ncontinuum, we will make the line of separation our own, in order to forge\n\nour path along it and dissociate the elements of the signifier (the dove of\nthe\n\nark). A narrow line of march, an in-between that is not a mean but a\n\nslender line. There is a Jewish specificity, immediately affirmed in a\n\nsemiotic system. This semiotic, however, is no less mixed than any other.\n\nOn the one hand, it is intimately related to the countersignifying regime of\n\nthe nomads (the Hebrews had a nomadic past, a continuing relationship\n\nwith the nomadic numerical organization that inspired them, and their\n\nown particular becoming-nomad; their line of deterritorialization owed\n\nmuch to the military line of nomadic destruction).\n\n14\n\nOn the other hand, it\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)144.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 123\n\nhas an essential relation to the signifying semiotic itself, for which the\n\nHebrews and their God would always be nostalgic: reestablish an imperial\n\nsociety and integrate with it, enthrone a king like everybody else (Samuel),\n\nrebuild a temple that would finally be solid (David and Solomon,\n\nZachariah), erect the spiral of the Tower of Babel and find the face of God\n\nagain; not just bring the wandering to a halt, but overcome the diaspora,\n\nwhich itself exists only as a function of an ideal regathering. We only have\n\nspace to indicate what, in this mixed semiotic, bears witness to the new\n\npostsignifying subjective or passional regime.\n\nFaciality undergoes a profound transformation. The god averts his face,\n\nwhich must be seen by no one; and the subject, gripped by a veritable fear of\n\nthe god, averts his or her face in turn. The averted faces, in profile,\nreplace\n\nthe frontal view of the radiant face. It is this double turning away that\ndraws\n\nthe positive line of flight. The prophet is the main figure in this\nassemblage;\n\nhe needs a sign to guarantee the word of God, he is himself marked by a sign\n\nindicating the special regime to which he belongs. It is Spinoza who has\n\nelaborated the profoundest theory of prophetism, taking into account the\n\nsemiotic proper to it. Cain, who turns away from the God who turns away\n\nfrom him, already follows the line of deterritorialization, protected by a\n\nsign allowing him to escape death. The mark of Cain. A punishment worse\n\nthan imperial death? The Jewish God invented the reprieve, existence in\n\nreprieve, _indefinite postponement._\n\n_15_\n\n_ _But He also invented the positivity of\n\nalliance, or the covenant, as the new relation with the deity, since the sub-\n\nject remains alive. Abel, whose name is vanity, is nothing; Cain is the true\n\nman. This is very different from the system of rigging or deception animat-\n\ning the face of the signifier, the interpretation of the seer and the\ndisplace-\n\nments of the subject. It is the regime of betrayal, universal betrayal, in\n\nwhich the true man never ceases to betray God just as God betrays man,\n\nwith the wrath of God defining the new positivity. Before his death, Moses\n\nreceives the words of the great song of betrayal. Even the prophet, unlike\n\nthe seer-priest, is fundamentally a traitor and thus fulfills God's order bet-\n\nter than anyone who remained faithful could. God calls upon Jonah to go to\n\nNineveh to entreat the inhabitants, who had repeatedly betrayed God, to\n\nmend their ways. But Jonah's first act is to take off in the opposite direc-\n\ntion; he also betrays God, fleeing \"far from the face of Adonai.\"\n\n16\n\nHe takes a\n\nship for Tarshish and sleeps, like a righteous man. The tempest sent by\n\nGod causes him to be thrown into the sea, where he is swallowed by the\n\ngreat fish and vomited out at the boundary between land and water, the\n\nlimit of separation or line of flight earlier occupied by the dove of the Ark\n\n(Jonah, precisely, is the word for dove). But Jonah, in fleeing from the face\n\nof God, did exactly what God had wanted: he took the evil of Nineveh\n\nupon himself; he did it even more effectively than God had wanted, he\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)145.png)\n\n0\n\n124 \u25a1\n\n587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\nanticipated God. That is why he slept like a righteous man. God let him\n\nlive, temporarily protected by the tree of Cain, but then made the tree die\n\nbecause Jonah had renewed the covenant by occupying the line of flight.\n\n17\n\nJesus universalizes the system of betrayal: he betrays the God of the Jews,\n\nhe betrays the Jews, he is betrayed by God (\"Why hast thou forsaken me?\"\n\n[Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34\u2014Trans.]), he is betrayed by Judas, the true\n\nman. He took evil upon himself, but the Jews who kill him also take it upon\n\nthemselves. Jesus is asked for a sign of his divine descendance: he invokes\n\nthe sign of Jonah [Luke 11:29\u2014Trans.]. Cain, Jonah, and Jesus constitute\n\nthree great linear proceedings along which signs rush and form relays.\n\nThere are many others. Everywhere a double turning away on a line of\n\nflight.\n\nWhen a prophet declines the burden God entrusts to him (Moses,\n\nJeremiah, Isaiah, etc.), it is not because the burden would have been too\n\nheavy, as with an imperial oracle or seer who refuses a dangerous mission.\n\nIt is instead a case like Jonah's, who by hiding and fleeing and betraying\n\nanticipates the will of God more effectively than if he had obeyed. The\n\nprophet is always being forced by God, literally violated by him, much\n\nmore than inspired by him. The prophet is not a priest. The prophet does\n\nnot know how to talk, God puts the words in his mouth: word-ingestion, a\n\nnew form of semiophagy. Unlike the seer, the prophet interprets nothing:  \n_his delusion is active rather than ideational or imaginative, _his relation\nto\n\nGod is passional and authoritative rather than despotic and signifying; he\n\nanticipates and detects the powers _{puissances) _of the future rather than\n\napplying past and present powers _(pouvoirs). _Faciality traits no longer\nfunc-\n\ntion to prevent the formation of a line of flight, or to form a body of\n\nsignifiance controlling that line and sending only a faceless goat down it.\n\nRather, it is faciality itself that organizes the line of flight, in the face-\noff\n\nbetween two countenances that become gaunt and turn away in profile.\n\nBetrayal has become an idee fixe, the main obsession, replacing the deceit\n\nof the paranoiac and the hysteric. The \"persecutor-persecuted\" relation\n\nhas no relevance whatsoever: its meaning is altogether different in the\n\nauthoritarian passional regime than in the despotic paranoid regime.\n\nSomething is still bothering us: the story of Oedipus. Oedipus is almost\n\nunique in the Greek world. The whole first part is imperial, despotic, para-\n\nnoid, interpretive, divinatory. But the whole second part is Oedipus's wan-\n\ndering, his line of flight, the double turning away of his own face and that\nof\n\nGod. Rather than very precise limits to be crossed in order, or which one\n\ndoes not have the right to cross _(hybris), _there is a concealed limit toward\n\nwhich Oedipus is swept. Rather than interpretive signifying irradiation,\n\nthere is a subjective linear proceeding permitting Oedipus to keep a secret,\n\nbut only as a residue capable of starting a new linear proceeding.

Holderlin and Heidegger see this as the birth of the  \n_double turning away, _the change of face, and also the birth of modern\n\ntragedy, for which they bizarrely credit the Greeks: the outcome is no\n\nlonger murder or sudden death but survival under reprieve, unlimited\n\npostponement.\n\n18\n\nNietzsche suggests that Oedipus, as opposed to\n\nPrometheus, was the Semitic myth of the Greeks, the glorification of\n\nPassion or passivity.'\n\n9\n\nOedipus: Greek Cain. Let us return to\n\npsychoanalysis. It was not by chance that Freud pounced upon Oedipus.\n\nPsychoanalysis is a definite case of a mixed semiotic: a despotic regime\n\nof signifiance and interpretation, with irradiation of the face, but also an\n\nauthoritarian regime of subjectification and prophetism, with a turning\n\naway of the face (the positioning of the psychoanalyst behind the patient\n\nsuddenly assumes its full significance). Recent efforts to explain that a\n\n\"signifier represents the subject for another signifier\" are typically\n\nsyncretic: a linear proceeding of subjectivity along with a circular\n\ndevelopment of the signifier and interpretation. Two absolutely different\n\nregimes of signs in a mix. But the worst, most underhanded of powers are\n\nfounded on it.\n\nOne more remark on the story of authoritarian passional betrayal, as\n\nopposed to despotic paranoid deception. Everything is infamy, but Borges\n\nbotched his history of universal infamy.\n\n20\n\nHe should have distinguished\n\nbetween the great realm of deceptions and the great realm of betrayals. And\n\nalso between the various figures of betrayal. There is, in effect, a second\nfig-\n\nure of betrayal that springs up at certain places at certain times, but always\n\nas a function of a variable assemblage with new components. Christianity\n\nis a particularly important case of a mixed semiotic, with its signifying\n\nimperial combination together with its postsignifying Jewish subjectivity.\n\nIt transforms both the ideal signifying system and the postsignifying\n\npassional system. It invents a new assemblage. Heresies are still a part of\n\ndeception, just as orthodoxy is a part of signifiance. But there are heresies\n\nthat are more than heresies and profess pure treason, for example, the\n\nBuggers; it is not by chance that the Bulgars played a special role.\n\n21\n\nBeware\n\nthe Bulgars, as Monsieur Plume would say. The problem is one of territori-\n\nalities in relation to deep movements of deterritorialization. England,\n\nanother territoriality or another deterritorialization: Cromwell, every-\n\nwhere a traitor, a straight line of passional subjectification opposed to the\n\nroyal center of signifiance and the intermediary circles: the dictator against\n\nthe despot. Richard III, the deformed, the twisted, whose ideal is to betray\n\neverything: he confronts Lady Anne in a face-off in which the two counte-\n\nnances turn away, but each knows she or he is the other's, destined for the\n\nother.

Richard III comes from elsewhere: his ven-\n\ntures, including those with women, derive more from a war machine than\n\nfrom a State apparatus. He is the traitor, springing from the great nomads\n\nand their secrecy. He says so from the beginning, when he mentions a secret\n\nproject infinitely surpassing the conquest of power. He wants to return the\n\nwar machine both to the fragile State and pacified couples. The only one to\n\nguess is Lady Anne, fascinated, terrified, consenting. Elizabethan theater\n\nis full of these traitorous characters who aspire to be absolute traitors, in\n\nopposition to the deceptions of the man of the court or even of the State.\n\nHow many betrayals accompanied the great discoveries of Christen-\n\ndom, the discovery of new lands and continents! Lines of\n\ndeterrito-rialization on which small groups betray everything, their\n\ncompanions, the king, the indigenous peoples, the neighboring explorer, in\n\nthe mad hope of founding, with a woman of their family, a race that\n\nwould finally be pure and represent a new beginning. Herzog's film,  \n_Aguirre, _is very Shakespearean. Aguirre asks, How can one be a traitor\n\neverywhere and in everything? I'm the only traitor here. No more\n\ndeception, it's time for betrayal. What a grandiose dream! I will be the last\n\ntraitor, the total traitor, and therefore the last man.\n\nThen there was the Reformation: the extraordinary figure of Luther, as\n\ntraitor to all things and all people; his personal relation with the Devil\n\nresulting in betrayal, through good deeds as well as bad.\n\nThese new figures of betrayal always return to the Old Testament: I am\n\nthe wrath of God. But betrayal has become humanist, it does not fall\n\nbetween God and his own men; it relies on God, but falls between the men\n\nof God and the others, denounced as deceivers. In the end, there is only one\n\nman of God or of the wrath of God, a single betrayer against all deceivers.\n\nBut every deceiver is mixed, and which does not take him- or herself to be\n\nthe one? And what betrayer does not say to him- or herself at some point\n\nthat he or she was nothing but a deceiver after all? (See the strange case of\n\nMaurice Sachs.)\n\nIt is clear that the book, or what takes its place, has a different meaning\n\nin the signifying paranoid regime than in the postsignifying passional\n\nregime. In the first case, there is an emission of the despotic signifier, and\n\nits interpretation by scribes and priests, which fixes the signified and\n\nreimparts signifier; but there is also, from sign to sign, a movement from\n\none territory to another, a circulation assuring a certain speed of\n\ndeterritorialization (for example, the circulation of an epic, or the rivalry\n\nbetween several cities for the birth of a hero, or, once again, the role of\n\nscribe-priests in exchanges of territorialities and genealogies).\n\n22\n\nWhat\n\ntakes the place of the book always has an external model, a referent, face,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)148.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 127\n\nfamily, or territory that preserves the book's oral character.

God manifests himself through trumpets and the Voice, but\n\nwhat is heard in sound is the nonface, just as what is seen in the book are\n\nwords. _The book has become the body of passion, _just as the face was the\n\nbody of the signifier. It is now the book, the most deterritorialized of\n\nthings, that fixes territories and genealogies. The latter are what the book\n\nsays, and the former the place at which the book is said. The function of\n\ninterpretation has totally changed. Or it disappears entirely in favor of a\n\npure and literal recitation forbidding the slightest change, addition, or\n\ncommentary (the famous \"stultify yourself of the Christians belongs to\n\nthis passional line; the Koran goes the furthest in this direction). Or else\n\ninterpretation survives but becomes internal to the book itself, which loses\n\nits circulatory function for outside elements: for example, the different\n\ntypes of coded interpretation are fixed according to axes internal to the\n\nbook; interpretation is organized according to correspondences between\n\ntwo books, such as the Old and New Testaments, and may even induce a\n\nthird book suffused by the same element of interiority.\n\n23\n\nFinally, interpre-\n\ntation may reject all intermediaries or specialists and become direct, since\n\nthe book is written both in itself and in the heart, once as a point of\n\nsubjectification and again in the subject (the Reformation conception of\n\nthe book). In any case, this is the point of departure for the delusional pas-\n\nsion of the book as origin and finality of the world. The unique book, the\n\ntotal work, all possible combinations _inside _the book, the tree-book, the\n\ncosmos-book: all of these platitudes so dear to the avant-gardes, which cut\n\nthe book off from its relations with the outside, are even worse than the\n\nchant of the signifier. Of course, they are entirely bound up with a mixed\n\nsemiotic. But in truth they have a particularly pious origin. Wagner,\n\nMallarme, and Joyce, Marx and Freud: still Bibles. If passional delusion is\n\nprofoundly monomaniacal, monomania for its part found a fundamental\n\nelement of its assemblage in monotheism and the Book. The strangest cult.\n\nThis is how things are in the passional regime, or the regime of\n\nsubjectification. There is no longer a center of signifiance connected to\n\nexpanding circles or an expanding spiral, but a point of subjectification\n\nconstituting the point of departure of the line. There is no longer a\n\nsignifier-signified relation, but a subject of enunciation issuing from the\n\npoint of subjectification and a subject of the statement in a determinable\n\nrelation to the first subject. There is no longer sign-to-sign circularity,\nbut a\n\nlinear proceeding into which the sign is swept via subjects.

In\nthe\n\nforegoing example of erotomania, as well as in jealousy and querulous\n\ndelusion, Clerambault stresses that a sign must follow a segment or linear\n\nproceeding through to the end before it can begin another, whereas the\n\nsigns in paranoid delusion form an endless, self-adjusting network devel-\n\noping in all directions.

The point of subjectification can be anything. It\n\nmust only display the following characteristic traits of the subjective\n\nsemiotic: the double turning away, betrayal, and existence under reprieve.\n\nFor anorexics, food plays this role (anorexics do not confront death but\n\nsave themselves by betraying food, which is equally a traitor since it is sus-\n\npected of containing larvae, worms, and microbes). A dress, an article of\n\nunderwear, a shoe are points of subjectification for a fetishist. So is a\n\nfaciality trait for someone in love, but the meaning of faciality has\n\nchanged; it is no longer the body of the signifier but has become the point\n\nof departure for a deterritorialization that puts everything else to flight. A\n\nthing, an animal, will do the trick. There are cogitos on everything. \"A\n\npair of eyes set far apart, a head hewn of quartz, a haunch that seemed to\n\nlive its own life.... Whenever the beauty of the female becomes irresisti-\n\nble, it is traceable to a single quality\":\n\n25\n\na point of subjectification in the\n\ndeparture of a passional line. Moreover, several points coexist in a given\n\nindividual or group, which are always engaged in several distinct and not\n\nalways compatible linear proceedings. The various forms of education or\n\n\"normalization\" imposed upon an individual consist in making him or her\n\nchange points of subjectification, always moving toward a higher, nobler\n\none in closer conformity with the supposed ideal. Then from the point of\n\nsubjectification issues a subject of enunciation, as a function of a mental\n\nreality determined by that point. Then from the subject of enunciation\n\nissues a subject of the statement, in other words, a subject bound to\n\nstatements in conformity with a dominant reality (of which the mental\n\nreality just mentioned is a part, even when it seems to oppose it). What is\n\nimportant, what makes the postsignifying passional line a line of subjecti-\n\nfication or subjection, is the constitution, the doubling of the two sub-\n\njects, and the recoiling of one into the other, of the subject of enunciation\n\ninto the subject of the statement (the linguists acknowledge this when\n\nthey speak of the \"imprint of the process of enunciation in the state-\n\nment\"). Signifiance brought about uniformity in the substance of enunci-\n\nation; now subjectivity effects an individuation, collective or particular.\n\nSubstance has become subject, as they say. _The subject of enunciation  \nrecoils into the subject of the statement, to the point that the subject of\nthe  \nstatement resupplies subject of enunciation for another proceeding. _The\n\nsubject of the statement has become the \"respondent\" or guarantor of the\n\nsubject of enunciation, through a kind of reductive echolalia, in a\n\nbiunivocal relation. This relation, this recoiling, is also that of mental\n\nreality into the dominant reality.

A strange inven-\n\ntion: as if in one form the doubled subject were the _causeof _the statements\n\nof which, in its other form, it itself is a part. This is the paradox of the\n\nlegislator-subject replacing the signifying despot: the more you obey the\n\nstatements of the dominant reality, the more in command you are as sub-\n\nject of enunciation in mental reality, for in the end you are only obeying\n\nyourself! You are the one in command, in your capacity as a rational\n\nbeing. A new form of slavery is invented, namely, being slave to oneself, or\n\nto pure \"reason,\" the Cogito. Is there anything more passional than pure\n\nreason? Is there a colder, more extreme, more self-interested passion than\n\nthe Cogito?\n\nAlthusser clearly brings out this constitution of social individuals as\n\nsubjects: he calls it interpellation (\"Hey you, over there!\") and calls the\n\npoint of subjectification the Absolute Subject; he analyzes the \"specular\n\ndoubling\" of subjects and for purposes of demonstration uses the example\n\nof God, Moses, and the Jewish people.\n\n26\n\nLinguists like Benveniste adopt a\n\ncurious linguistic personology that is very close to the Cogito: the _You, _\n\nwhich can doubtless designate the person one is addressing, but more\n\nimportantly, a point of subjectification on the basis of which each of us is\n\nconstituted as a subject. The /as subject of enunciation, designating the\n\nperson that utters and reflects its own use in the statement (\"the empty\n\nnonreferential sign\"); this is the I appearing in propositions of the type \"I\n\nbelieve, I assume, I think...\" Finally, the I as subject of the statement,\n\nindicating a state for which a _She _or _He _could always be substituted (\"I\nsuf-\n\nfer, I walk, I breathe, I feel.. .\").\n\n27\n\nThis is not, however, a question of a lin-\n\nguistic operation, for a subject is never the condition of possibility of\n\nlanguage or the cause of the statement: there is no subject, only collective\n\nassemblages of enunciation. Subjectification is simply one such assem-\n\nblage and designates a formalization of expression or a regime of signs\n\nrather than a condition internal to language. Neither is it a question of a\n\nmovement characteristic of ideology, as Althusser says: subjectification as\n\na regime of signs or a form of expression is tied to an assemblage, in other\n\nwords, an organization of power that is already fully functioning in the\n\neconomy, rather than superposing itself upon contents or relations\n\nbetween contents determined as real in the last instance. Capital is a point\n\nof subjectification par excellence.\n\nThe psychoanalytic cogito: the psychoanalyst presents him- or herself as\n\nan ideal point of subjectification that brings the patient to abandon old,\n\nso-called neurotic, points. The patient is partially a subject of enunciation\n\nin all he or she says to the psychoanalyst, and under the artificial mental\n\nconditions of the session: the patient is therefore called the \"analysand.\"\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)152.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 131\n\nBut in everything else the patient says or does, he or she is a subject of the\n\nstatement, eternally psychoanalyzed, going from one linear proceeding to\n\nanother, perhaps even changing analysts, growing increasingly submissive\n\nto the normalization of a dominant reality. In this sense, psychoanalysis,\n\nwith its mixed semiotic, fully participates in a line of subjectification. The\n\npsychoanalyst does not even have to speak anymore, the analysand\n\nassumes the burden of interpretation; as for the psychoanalyzed patient,\n\nthe more he or she thinks about \"his\" or \"her\" next session, or the preced-\n\ning one, in segments, the better a subject he or she is.\n\nJust as the paranoid regime had two axes\u2014one sign referring to another\n\n(making the sign a signifier), and the signifier referring to the signified\u2014so\n\ntoo the passional regime, the line of subjectification, has two axes, one\n\nsyntagmatic and the other paradigmatic: as we have just seen, the first axis\n\nis consciousness. Consciousness as passion is precisely that doubling of\n\nsubjects, of the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement, and\n\nthe recoiling of one into the other. But the second form of subjectification\n\nis love as passion, love-passion, another type of double, of doubling and\n\nrecoiling. Here again, a variable point of subjectification serves to distrib-\n\nute two subjects that as much conceal their faces as reveal them to each\n\nother, that wed a line of flight, a line of deterritorialization forever\ndrawing\n\nthem together and driving them apart. But everything changes: there is a\n\ncelibate side to this doubled consciousness, and there is a passional love\n\ncouple that no longer has any use for consciousness or reason. Yet it is the\n\nsame regime, even in betrayal and even if the betraying is done by a third\n\nparty. Adam and Eve, and Cain's wife (about whom the Bible should have\n\nsaid more). Richard III, the traitor, is in the end given consciousness in a\n\ndream, but only the strange face-off with Lady Anne, a meeting of two\n\ncountenances that conceal themselves knowing that they have promised\n\nthemselves to each other following the same line that will nonetheless sepa-\n\nrate them. The most loyal and tender, or intense, love assigns subject of\n\nenunciation and a subject of the statement that constantly switch places,\n\nwrapped in the sweetness of being a naked statement in the other's mouth,\n\nand of the other's being a naked enunciation in my own mouth. But there is\n\nalways a traitor in the making. What love is not betrayed? What cogito lacks\n\nits evil genius, the traitor it will never be rid of? \"Tristan . . . Isolde .\n. .\n\nIsolde.. . Tristan\": the cry of the two subjects climbs the scale of\nintensities\n\nuntil it reaches the summit of a suffocating consciousness, whereas the ship\n\nfollows the line of the waters, the line of death and the unconscious,\n\nbetrayal, a continuous melody line. Passional love is a cogito built for two,\n\njust as the cogito is a passion for the self alone. There is a potential\ncouple in\n\nthe cogito, just as there is a doubling of a single virtual subject in\n\nlove-passion.

The line of subjectification is thus entirely occupied by the Double,\n\nbut it has two figures since there are two kinds of doubles: the syntagmatic\n\nfigure of consciousness, or the consciousness-related double, relating to\n\nform (Self = Self _[Moi = Moi]); _and the paradigmatic figure of the couple,\n\nor the passional double, relating to substance (Man = Woman; here, the\n\ndouble is immediately the difference between the sexes).\n\nWe can follow the becoming of these doubles in mixed semiotics, which\n\nare interminglings as well as degradations. On the one hand, the passional\n\nlove double, the couple in love-passion, falls into a conjugal relation or\n\neven a \"domestic squabble\" situation: Which is the subject of enunciation?\n\nWhich is the subject of the statement? The battle of the sexes: _You 're\nsteal-  \ning my thoughts. _The domestic squabble has always been a cogito for two, a\n\nwar cogito. Strindberg took this fall of love-passion into despotic conju-\n\ngality and hysterico-paranoid squabbling to its extreme (\"she\" says she\n\nfound it all by herself when in fact she owes it all to me, echo, thought\ntheft,\n\nO Strindberg!).\n\n28\n\nOn the other hand, the consciousness-related double of\n\npure thought, the couple of the legislating subject, falls into a bureaucratic\n\nrelation and a new form of persecution in which one double takes over the\n\nrole of subject of enunciation while the other is reduced to a subject of the\n\nstatement; the cogito itself becomes an \"office squabble,\" a bureaucratic\n\nlove delusion. A new form of bureaucracy replaces or conjugates with the\n\nold imperial bureaucracy, the bureaucrat says / _think _(Kafka goes the fur-\n\nthest in this direction, as in the example of Sortini and Sordini in _The Cas-  \ntle, _or the many subjectifications of Klamm).\n\n29\n\nConjugality is the\n\ndevelopment of the couple, and bureaucracy the development of the\n\ncogito. But one is contained in the other: amorous bureaucracy, bureau-\n\ncratic couple. Too much has been written on the double, haphazardly,\n\nmetaphysically, finding it everywhere, in any old mirror, without noticing\n\nthe specific regime it possesses both in a mixed semiotic where it intro-\n\nduces new phases, and in the pure semiotic of subjectification where it\n\ninscribes itself on a line of flight and introduces very particular figures.\n\nOnce again: the two figures of thought-consciousness and love-passion in\n\nthe postsignifying regime; the two moments of bureaucratic consciousness\n\nand conjugal relation in the mixed fall or combination. But even in a mixed\n\nstate, the original line is easily discovered by semiotic analysis.\n\nThere is a redundancy of consciousness and love that is not the same as\n\nthe signifying redundancy of the other regime. In the signifying regime,\n\nredundancy is a phenomenon of objective _frequency _involving signs or ele-\n\nments of signs (the phonemes, letters, and groups of letters in a language):\n\nthere is both a maximum frequency of the signifier in relation to each sign,\n\nand a comparative frequency of one sign in relation to another. In any case,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)154.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS D 133\n\nit could be said that this regime develops a kind of \"wall\" on which signs are\n\ninscribed, in relation to one another and in relation to the signifier. In the\n\npostsignifying regime, on the other hand, the redundancy is one of _subjec-  \ntive resonance _involving above all shifters, personal pronouns and proper\n\nnames. Here again, we may distinguish between the maximum resonance\n\nof self-consciousness (Self = Self _[Moi _= _Moi]) _and a comparative reso-\n\nnance of names (Tristan ... Isolde ...). This time, however, there is no\n\nlonger a wall upon which the frequency is tallied but instead a black hole\n\nattracting consciousness and passion and in which they resonate. Tristan\n\ncalls Isolde, Isolde calls Tristan, both drawn toward the black hole of a\n\nself-consciousness, carried by the tide toward death. When the linguists\n\ndistinguish between two forms of redundancy, frequency and resonance,\n\nthey often ascribe the latter a merely derivative status.\n\n30\n\nIn fact, it is a\n\nquestion of two semiotics that mix but retain their own distinct principles\n\n(similarly, one could define other forms of redundancy, such as rhythmic,\n\ngestural, or numerical, relating to the other regimes of signs). The most\n\nessential distinction between the signifying regime and the subjective\n\nregime and their respective redundancies is the _movement of  \ndeterritorialization _they effectuate. Since the signifying sign refers only\nto\n\nother signs, and the set of all signs to the signifier itself, the\ncorresponding\n\nsemiotic enjoys a high level of deterritorialization; but it is a\n\ndeterritorialization that is still _relative, _expressed as frequency. In this\n\nsystem, the line of flight remains negative, it is assigned a negative sign.\n\nAs we have seen, the subjective regime proceeds entirely differently:\n\nprecisely because the sign breaks its relation of signifiance with other\n\nsigns and sets off racing down a positive line of flight, it attains an  \n_absolute _deterritorialization expressed in the black hole of consciousness\n\nand passion. The absolute deterritorialization of the cogito. That is why\n\nsubjective redundancy seems both to graft itself onto signifying\n\nredundancy and to derive from it, as second-degree redundancy.\n\nThings are even more complicated than we have let on. Subjectification\n\nassigns the line of flight a positive sign, it carries deterritorialization to\nthe\n\nabsolute, intensity to the highest degree, redundancy to a reflexive form,\n\netc. But it has its own way of repudiating the positivity it frees, or of\n\nrelativizing the absoluteness it attains, without, however, falling back to\n\nthe preceding regime. In this redundancy of resonance, the absolute of con-\n\nsciousness is the absolute of impotence and the intensity of passion, the\n\nheat of the void. This is because subjectification essentially constitutes\n\nfinite linear proceedings, one of which ends before the next begins: thus the\n\ncogito is always recommenced, a passion or grievance is always recapitu-\n\nlated. Every consciousness pursues its own death, every love-passion its\n\nown end, attracted by a black hole, and all the black holes resonate together.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)155.png)\n\n0\n\n134 \u25a1\n\n587 B.c.-AD. 70. ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\nThus subjectification imposes on the line of flight a segmentarity that is\n\nforever repudiating that line, and upon absolute deterritorialization a\n\npoint of abolition that is forever blocking that deterritorialization or\n\ndiverting it. The reason for this is simple: forms of expression and regimes\n\nof signs are still _strata _(even considered in themselves, after abstracting\n\nforms of content); subjectification is no less a stratum than signifiance.\n\nThe principal strata binding human beings are the organism, signifiance\n\nand interpretation, and subjectification and subjection. These strata to-\n\ngether are what separates us from the plane of consistency and the abstract\n\nmachine, where there is no longer any regime of signs, where the line of\n\nflight effectuates its own potential positivity and deterritorialization its\n\nabsolute power. The problem, from this standpoint, is to tip the most favor-\n\nable assemblage from its side facing the strata to its side facing the plane\nof\n\nconsistency or the body without organs. Subjectification carries desire to\n\nsuch a point of excess and unloosening that it must either annihilate itself\n\nin a black hole or change planes. Destratify, open up to a new function, a  \n_diagrammatic _function. Let consciousness cease to be its own double, and\n\npassion the double of one person for another. Make consciousness an\n\nexperimentation in life, and passion a field of continuous intensities, an\n\nemission of particles-signs. Make the body without organs of conscious-\n\nness and love. Use love and consciousness to abolish subjectification: \"To\n\nbecome the great lover, the magnetizer and catalyzer ... one has to first\n\nexperience the profound wisdom of being an utter fool.\"\n\n31\n\nUse the / _think _\n\nfor a becoming-animal, and love for a becoming-woman of man.\n\nDesub-jectify consciousness and passion.

This time, it is no longer a question of concrete mixed\n\nsemiotics but of transformations of one abstract semiotic into another\n\n(even though that transformation is not itself abstract, in other words,\n\neffectively takes place without being performed by a \"translator\" in the\n\nrole of pure knower). All transformations taking a given semiotic into the\n\npresignifying regime may be called _analogical transformations; _those that\n\ntake it into the signifying regime are _symbolic; _into the countersignifying\n\nregime, _polemical or strategic; _into the postsignifying regime, _conscious-  \nness-related or mimetic; _finally, transformations that blow apart semiotics\n\nsystems or regimes of signs on the plane of consistency of a positive abso-\n\nlute deterritorialization are called _diagrammatic. _A transformation is not\n\nthe same thing as a statement in a pure semiotic; nor even an ambiguous\n\nstatement requiring a whole pragmatic analysis to determine the semiotic\n\nit belongs to; nor a statement belonging to a mixed semiotic (although the\n\ntransformation may have that effect). A transformational statement marks\n\nthe way in which a semiotic translates for its own purposes a statement\n\noriginating elsewhere, and in so doing diverts it, leaving untransformable\n\nresidues and actively resisting the inverse transformation. Furthermore,\n\ntransformations are not limited to the ones we just listed. It is always\n\nthrough transformation that a new semiotic is created in its own right.\n\nTranslations can be creative.

In each case we must judge whether what we see\n\nis an adaptation of an old semiotic, a new variety of a particular mixed\n\nsemiotic, or the process of creation of an as yet unknown regime. For exam-\n\nple, it is relatively easy to stop saying \"I,\" but that does not mean that you\n\nhave gotten away from the regime of subjectification; conversely, you can\n\nkeep on saying \"I,\" just for kicks, and already be in another regime in which\n\npersonal pronouns function only as fictions. Signifiance and interpretation\n\nare so thick-skinned, they form such a sticky mixture with sub-\n\njectification, that it is easy to believe that you are outside them when you\n\nare in fact still secreting them. People sometimes denounce interpretation\n\nyet show so signifying a face that they simultaneously impose interpreta-\n\ntion upon the subject, which continues to nourish itself on it in order to\nsur-\n\nvive. Who can really believe that psychoanalysis is capable of changing a\n\nsemiotic amassing every deception? The only change there has been is a\n\nrole switch. Instead of a patient who signifies and a psychoanalyst who\n\ninterprets, we now have a signifying analyst and it is the patient who does\n\nall the interpreting. In the antipsychiatric experiment of Kingsley Hall,\n\nMary Barnes, a former nurse turned \"schizophrenic,\" embraces the new\n\nsemiotic of the Voyage, only to arrogate to herself a veritable power in the\n\ncommunity and reintroduce as a collective delusion the worst kind of psy-\n\nchoanalytic regime of interpretation (\"She _interpreted _everything that was\n\ndone for her, or for anyone else for that matter. . .\").\n\n36\n\nA highly stratified\n\nsemiotic is difficult to get away from. Even a presignifying, or\n\ncounter-signifying, semiotic, even an asignifying diagram, harbors knots of\n\ncoincidence just waiting to form virtual centers of signifiance and points\n\nof subjectification. Of course, an operation of translation is not easy when\n\nit is a question of destroying a dominant atmospheric semiotic. One of the\n\nthings of profound interest in Castaneda's books, under the influence of\n\ndrugs, or other things, and of a change of atmosphere, is precisely that they\n\nshow how the Indian manages to combat the mechanisms of interpretation\n\nand instill in the disciple a presignifying semiotic, or even an asignifying\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)160.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 139\n\ndiagram: Stop!

The first could be\n\ncalled _generative _since it shows how the various abstract regimes form con-\n\ncrete mixed semiotics, with what variants, how they combine, and which\n\none is predominant. The second is the _transformational _component, which\n\nshows how these regimes of signs are translated into each other, especially\n\nwhen there is a creation of a new regime. Generative pragmatics makes\n\ntracings of mixed semiotics; transformational pragmatics makes maps of\n\ntransformations. Although a mixed semiotic does not necessarily imply\n\neffective creativity, and may content itself with combinatory possibilities\n\nwithout veritable transformation, it is still the transformational compo-\n\nnent that accounts for the originality of a regime as well as for the novelty\nof\n\nthe mixes it enters at a given moment in a given domain. This second com-\n\nponent is therefore the more profound, and it is the only means of measur-\n\ning the elements of the first component.\n\n38\n\nFor example, we may ask when\n\nstatements of the Bolshevik type first appeared, and how Leninism, at the\n\ntime of the break with the social democrats, effected a veritable transfor-\n\nmation that created an original semiotic, even if its fall into the mixed\n\nsemiotic of Stalinist organization was inevitable. In an exemplary study,\n\nJean-Pierre Faye did a detailed analysis of the transformations that pro-\n\nduced Nazism, viewed as a system of new statements in a given social field.\n\nAt what moment is a regime of signs established, and in what domain?\n\nThroughout an entire people? In a fraction of that people? In a more or less\n\nlocalizable margin inside a psychiatric hospital? (For as we have seen we\n\ncan find a semiotic of subjectification in the ancient history of the Jews,\n\nbut also in psychiatric diagnosis in the nineteenth century, with, of course,\n\nprofound variations and even veritable transformations in the correspond-\n\ning semiotic.) All of these questions fall within the purview of pragmatics.\n\nThere is no question that the most profound transformations and transla-\n\ntions of our time are not occurring in Europe. Pragmatics should reject the\n\nidea of an invariant immune from transformation, even if it is the in-\n\nvariant of a dominant \"grammaticality.\" For language is a political affair\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)161.png)\n\n0\n\n140 D\n\n587 B.C.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\nbefore it is an affair for linguistics; even the evaluation of degrees of\n\ngram-maticality is a political matter.\n\nWhat is a semiotic, in other words, a regime of signs or a formalization\n\nof expression? They are simultaneously more and less than language.\n\nLanguage as a whole is defined by \"superlinearity,\" its condition of possi-\n\nbility; individual languages are defined by constants, elements, and rela-\n\ntions of a phonological, syntactical, and semantic nature. Doubtless,\n\nevery regime of signs effectuates the condition of possibility of language\n\nand utilizes language elements, but that is all. No regime can be identical\n\nto that condition of possibility, and no regime has the property of con-\n\nstants. As Foucault clearly shows, regimes of signs are only _functions of  \nexistence _of language that sometimes span a number of languages and are\n\nsometimes distributed within a single language; they coincide neither\n\nwith a structure nor with units of a given order, but rather intersect them\n\nand cause them to appear in space and time. This is the sense in which\n\nregimes of signs are assemblages of enunciation, which cannot be ade-\n\nquately accounted for by any linguistic category: _what makes a proposi-  \ntion or even a single word a \"statement\" _pertains to implicit presupposi-\n\ntions that cannot be made explicit, that mobilize pragmatic variables\n\nproper to enunciation (incorporeal transformations). This precludes\n\nexplaining an assemblage in terms of the signifier or the subject, because\n\nboth pertain to variables of enunciation within the assemblage. It is\n\nsignifiance and subjectification that presuppose the assemblage, not the\n\nreverse. The names we gave to the regimes of signs (\"presignifying,\" \"sig-\n\nnifying,\" \"countersignifying,\" \"postsignifying\") would remain evolution-\n\nist if heterogeneous functions or varieties of assemblages did not\n\neffectively correspond to them (segmentarization, signifiance and inter-\n\npretation, numeration, subjectification). Regimes of signs are thus defined\n\nby variables that are internal to enunciation but remain external to the\n\nconstants of language and irreducible to linguistic categories.\n\nBut at this point, everything turns around, and the reasons why a regime\n\nof signs is less than language also become the reasons why it is more than\n\nlanguage. Only one side of the assemblage has to do with enunciation or\n\nformalizes expression; on its other side, inseparable from the first, it for-\n\nmalizes contents, it is a machinic assemblage or an assemblage of bodies.\n\nNow contents are not \"signifieds\" dependent upon a signifier in any way,\n\nnor are they \"objects\" in any kind of relation of causality with the subject.\n\nThey have their own formalization and have no relation of symbolic corre-\n\nspondence or linear causality with the form of expression: the two forms\n\nare in reciprocal presupposition, and they can be abstracted from each\n\nother only in a very relative way because they are two sides of a single\n\nassemblage. We must therefore arrive at something in the assemblage itself\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)162.png)\n\n587 B.c.-AD. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 141\n\nthat is still more profound than these sides and can account for both of the\n\nforms in presupposition, forms of expression or regimes of signs (semiotic\n\nsystems) and forms of content or regimes of bodies (physical systems). This\n\nis what we call the _abstract machine, _which constitutes and conjugates all\nof\n\nthe assemblage's cutting edges of deterritorialization.\n\n39\n\nWe must say that\n\nthe abstract machine is necessarily \"much more\" than language. When lin-\n\nguists (following Chomsky) rise to the idea of a purely language-based\n\nabstract machine, our immediate objection is that their machine, far from\n\nbeing too abstract, is not abstract enough because it is limited to the form\nof\n\nexpression and to alleged uni versals that presuppose language. Abstracting\n\ncontent is an operation that appears all the more relative and inadequate\n\nwhen seen from the viewpoint of abstraction itself. A true abstract machine\n\nhas no way of making a distinction within itself between a plane of expres-\n\nsion and a plane of content because it draws a single plane of consistency,\n\nwhich in turn formalizes contents and expressions according to strata and\n\nreterritorializations. The abstract machine in itself is destratified,\n\ndeter-ritorialized; it has no form of its own (much less substance) and\n\nmakes no distinction within itself between content and expression, even\n\nthough outside itself it presides over that distinction and distributes it in\n\nstrata, domains, and territories. An abstract machine in itself is not\n\nphysical or corporeal, any more than it is semiotic; it is _diagrammatic _(it\n\nknows nothing of the distinction between the artificial and the natural\n\neither). It operates by _matter, _not by substance; by _function, _not by\nform.\n\nSubstances and forms are of expression \"or\" of content. But functions are\n\nnot yet \"semiotically\" formed, and matters are not yet \"physically\"\n\nformed. The abstract machine is pure Matter-Function\u2014a diagram\n\nindependent of the forms and substances, expressions and contents it will\n\ndistribute.\n\nWe define the abstract machine as the aspect or moment at which noth-\n\ning but functions and matters remain. A diagram has neither substance nor\n\nform, neither content nor expression.\n\n40\n\nSubstance is a formed matter, and\n\nmatter is a substance that is unformed either physically or semiotically.\n\nWhereas expression and content have distinct forms, are really distinct\n\nfrom each other, function has only \"traits,\" of content and of expression,\n\nbetween which it establishes a connection: it is no longer even possible to\n\ntell whether it is a particle or a sign.

The most\n\ndeterritorialized element causes the other element to cross a threshold ena-\n\nbling a conjunction of their respective deterritorializations, a shared accel-\n\neration. This is the abstract machine's absolute, positive\n\ndeterritoria-lization. That is why _diagrams _must be distinguished from  \n_indexes, _which are territorial signs, but also from _icons, _which pertain\nto\n\nreterrito-rialization, and from _symbols, _which pertain to relative or\n\nnegative deterri-torialization.\n\n41\n\nDefined diagrammatically in this way, an\n\nabstract machine is neither an infrastructure that is determining in the last\n\ninstance nor a transcendental Idea that is determining in the supreme\n\ninstance. Rather, it plays a piloting role. The diagrammatic or abstract\n\nmachine does not function to represent, even something real, but rather\n\nconstructs a real that is yet to come, a new type of reality. Thus when it\n\nconstitutes points of creation or potentiality it does not stand outside\n\nhistory but is instead always \"prior to\" history. Everything escapes,\n\neverything creates\u2014never alone, but through an abstract machine that\n\nproduces continuums of intensity, effects conjunctions of\n\ndeterritorialization, and extracts expressions and contents. This\n\nReal-Abstract is totally different from the fictitious abstraction of a\n\nsupposedly pure machine of expression. It is an Absolute, but one that is\n\nneither undifferentiated nor transcendent. Abstract machines thus have\n\nproper names (as well as dates), which of course designate not persons or\n\nsubjects but matters and functions. The name of a musician or scientist is\n\nused in the same way as a painter's name designates a color, nuance, tone, or\n\nintensity: it is always a question of a conjunction of Matter and Function.\n\nThe double deterritorialization of the voice and the instrument is marked\n\nby a Wagner abstract machine, a Webern abstract machine, etc. In physics\n\nand mathematics, we may speak of a Riemann abstract machine, and in\n\nalgebra of a Galois abstract machine (defined precisely by an arbitrary\n\nline, called the adjunctive line, which conjugates with a body taken as a\n\nstarting point), etc. There is a diagram whenever a singular abstract\n\nmachine functions directly in a matter.\n\nStrictly speaking, therefore, there are no regimes of signs on the dia-\n\ngrammatic level, or on the plane of consistency, because form of expression\n\nis no longer really distinct from form of content. The diagram knows only\n\ntraits and cutting edges that are still elements of content insofar as they\nare\n\nmaterial and of expression insofar as they are functional, but which draw\n\none another along, form relays, and meld in a shared deterritorialization:\n\nparticles-signs. There is nothing surprising in this, for the real distinction\n\nbetween form of expression and form of content appears only with the\n\nstrata, and is different on each one.

The deeper\n\nmovement for conjugating matter and function\u2014absolute\n\ndeterri-torialization, identical to the earth itself\u2014appears only in the form\n\nof respective territorialities, negative or relative deterritorializations,\nand\n\ncomplementary reterritorializations. All of this culminates in a language\n\nstratum that installs an abstract machine on the level of expression and\n\ntakes the abstraction of content even further, tending to strip it of any form\n\nof its own (the imperialism of language, the pretensions to a general\n\nsemiology). In short, the strata substantialize diagrammatic matters and\n\nseparate a formed plane of content from a formed plane of expression.\n\nThey hold expressions and contents, separately substantialized and forma-\n\nlized, in the pincers of a double articulation assuring their independence\n\nand real distinction and enthroning a dualism that endlessly reproduces\n\nand redivides. They shatter the continuums of intensity, introducing\n\nbreaks between different strata and within each stratum. They prevent\n\nconjunctions of flight from forming and crush the cutting edges of\n\ndeterri-torialization, either by effecting reterritorializations that make\n\nthese movements merely relative, or by assigning certain of the lines an\n\nentirely negative value, or again by segmenting them, blocking them,\n\nplugging them, or plunging them into a kind of black hole.\n\nAbove all, diagrammaticism should not be confused with an operation\n\nof the axiomatic type. Far from drawing creative lines of flight and conju-\n\ngating traits of positive deterritorialization, axiomatics blocks all lines,\n\nsubordinates them to a punctual system, and halts the geometric and alge-\n\nbraic writing systems that had begun to run off in all directions. This hap-\n\npened in relation to the question of indeterminism in physics: a \"reorder-\n\ning\" was undertaken to reconcile it with physical determinism. Mathemat-\n\nical writing systems were axiomatized, in other words, restratified,\n\nresemiotized, and material flows were rephysicalized. It is as much a politi-\n\ncal as a scientific affair: science must not go crazy. Hilbert and de Broglie\n\nwere as much politicians as scientists: they reestablished order. An\n\naxiomatization, a semiotization, a physicalization, is not a diagram but in\n\nfact the opposite of a diagram. The program of a stratum, against the dia-\n\ngram of the plane of consistency.

The phrase \"the politics of\nsci-\n\nence\" is a good designation for these currents, which are internal to science\n\nand not simply circumstances and State factors that act upon it from the\n\noutside, leading it to make as atomic bomb here and embark upon a space\n\nprogram there. These political influences or determinations would not\n\nexist if science itself did not have its own poles, oscillations, strata, and\n\ndestratifications, its own lines of flight and reorderings, in short, the more\n\nor less potential events of its own politics, its own particular \"polemics,\"\nits\n\nown internal war machine (of which thwarted, persecuted, or hindered sci-\n\nentists are historically a part). It is not enough to say that axiomatics does\n\nnot take invention and creation into account: it possesses a deliberate will\n\nto halt or stabilize the diagram, to take its place by lodging itself on a\nlevel\n\nof coagulated abstraction too large for the concrete but too small for the\n\nreal. We will see in what sense this is the \"capitalist\" level.\n\nWe cannot, however, content ourselves with a dualism between the\n\nplane of consistency and its diagrams and abstract machines on the one\n\nhand, and the strata and their programs and concrete assemblages on the\n\nother. Abstract machines do not exist only on the plane of consistency,\n\nupon which they develop diagrams; they are already present enveloped or\n\n\"encasted\" in the strata in general, or even erected on particular strata\n\nupon which they simultaneously organize a form of expression and a form\n\nof content. What is illusory in the second case is the idea of an exclusively\n\nexpressive or language-based abstract machine, not the idea of an abstract\n\nmachine internal to the stratum and accounting for the relativity of those\n\ntwo distinct forms. Thus there are two complementary movements, one by\n\nwhich abstract machines work the strata and are constantly setting things\n\nloose, another by which they are effectively stratified, effectively captured\n\nby the strata. _On the one hand, _strata could never organize themselves if\n\nthey did not harness diagrammatic matters or functions and formalize\n\nthem from the standpoint of both expression and content; every regime of\n\nsigns, and even signifiance and subjectification, is still a diagrammatic\n\neffect (although relativized and negativized). _One the other hand, _abstract\n\nmachines would never be present, even on the strata, if they did not have\n\nthe power or potentiality to extract and accelerate destratified\n\nparticles-signs (the passage to the absolute).

All of these states or modes of the abstract machine coexist in\n\nwhat we call the _machinic assemblage. _The assemblage has two poles or\n\nvectors: one vector is oriented toward the strata, upon which it distributes\n\nterritorialities, relative deterritorializations, and reterritorializations;\nthe\n\nother is oriented toward the plane of consistency or destratification, upon\n\nwhich it conjugates processes of deterritorialization, carrying them to the\n\nabsolute of the earth. It is along its stratic vector that the assemblage\ndiffer-\n\nentiates a form of expression (from the standpoint of which it appears as a\n\ncollective assemblage of enunciation) from a form of content (from the\n\nstandpoint of which it appears as a machinic assemblage of bodies); it fits\n\none form to the other, one manifestation to the other, placing them in recip-\n\nrocal presupposition. But along its diagrammatic or destratified vector, it\n\nno longer has two sides; all it retains are traits of expression and content\n\nfrom which it extracts degrees of deterritorialization that add together and\n\ncutting edges that conjugate.\n\nA regime of signs has more than just two components. It has, in fact, four\n\nof them, which form the object of Pragmatics. The first was the _generative _\n\ncomponent, which shows how a form of expression located on the language\n\nstratum always appeals to several combined regimes, in other words, how\n\nevery regime of signs or semiotic is concretely mixed. On the level of this\n\ncomponent, one _can _abstract forms of content, most successfully if empha-\n\nsis is placed on the mixture of regimes in the form of expression: one should\n\nnot, however, conclude from this the predominance of a regime constitut-\n\ning a general semiology and unifying forms. The second, _transformational, _\n\ncomponent, shows how one abstract regime can be translated, transformed\n\ninto another, and especially how it can be created from other regimes. This\n\nsecond component is obviously more profound, because all mixed regimes\n\npresuppose these transformations from one regime to another, past, pres-\n\nent, or potential (as a function of the creation of new regimes). Once again,\n\none abstracts, or can abstract, content, since the analysis is limited to\nmeta-\n\nmorphoses internal to the form of expression, even though the form of\n\nexpression is not adequate to account for them. The third component is  \n_diagrammatic: _it consists in taking regimes of signs or forms of expression\n\nand extracting from them particles-signs that are no longer formalized but\n\ninstead constitute unformed traits capable of combining with one another.\n\nThis is the height of abstraction, but also the moment at which abstraction\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)167.png)\n\n146 \u25a1 587 B.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS\n\nbecomes real; everything operates through abstract-real machines (which\n\nhave names and dates). One can abstract forms of content, but one must\n\nsimultaneously abstract forms of expression; for what is retained of each\n\nare only unformed traits. That is why an abstract machine that would oper-\n\nate purely on the level of language is an absurdity. It is clear that this\ndia-\n\ngrammatic component is in turn more profound than the transformational\n\ncomponent: the creations-transformations of a regime of signs operate by\n\nthe emergence of ever-new abstract machines. Finally, the last, properly  \n_machinic, _component is meant to show how abstract machines are effectu-\n\nated in concrete assemblages; it is these assemblages that give distinct form\n\nto traits of expression, but not without doing the same for traits of\n\ncontent\u2014the two forms being in reciprocal presupposition, or having a\n\nnecessary, unformed relation that once again prevents the form of expres-\n\nsion from behaving as though it were self-sufficient (although it is indepen-\n\ndent or distinct in a strictly formal way).\n\nThus pragmatics (or schizoanalysis) can be represented by four circular\n\ncomponents that bud and form rhizomes.\n\n(1) The generative component: the study of concrete mixed semiotics; their\nmixtures\n\nand variations. (2) The transformational component: the study of pure\nsemiotics; their\n\ntransformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics. (3) The\ndiagrammatic\n\ncomponent: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically\n\nunformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. (4) The machinic\ncom-\n\nponent: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines,\nsimultaneously\n\nsemiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content.\n\nPragmatics as a whole would consist in this: making a _tracing _of the\n\nmixed semiotics, under the generative component; making the transfor-\n\nmational _map _of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and\n\ncreation, for budding along the lines of the tracings; making the _diagram _of\n\nthe abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities\n\nor as effective emergences; outlining the _program _of the assemblages that\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)168.png)\n\n0\n\n587\n\nB.c.-A.D. 70: ON SEVERAL REGIMES OF SIGNS \u25a1 147\n\ndistribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives,\n\njumps, and mutations.\n\nFor example, in considering a given \"proposition,\" in other words, a ver-\n\nbal aggregate defined syntactically, semantically, and logically as the\n\nexpression of an individual or group (\"I love you\" or \"I am jealous\"), one\n\nwould begin by asking to which \"statement\" this proposition corresponds\n\nin the group or individual (for the same proposition can be tied to com-\n\npletely different statements). This question means: What regime of signs is\n\nthe proposition taken up by and without which its syntactical, semantic,\n\nand logical elements would remain totally empty universal conditions?\n\nWhat nonlinguistic element, or variable of enunciation, gives it consis-\n\ntency? There is a presignifying \"I love you\" of the collective type in which,\n\nas Miller says, a dance weds all the women of the tribe; there is a\n\ncounter-signifying \"I love you\" of the distributive and polemical type that\n\nhas to do with war and relations of force (the \"I love you\" of Penthesilea\n\nand Achilles); there is an \"I love you\" that is addressed to a center of\n\nsignifiance and uses interpretation to make a whole series of signifieds\n\ncorrespond to the signifying chain; and there is a postsignifying or\n\npassional \"I love you\" that constitutes a proceeding beginning from a\n\npoint of subjectification, then another, and yet another. Similarly, the\n\nproposition \"I am jealous\" is clearly not the same statement in the\n\npassional regime of subjectification as in the paranoid regime of\n\nsignifiance: these are two distinct delusions. Second, once it has been\n\ndetermined which statement the proposition corresponds to in a given\n\ngroup or individual at a given time, one would look into the possibilities\n\nnot only of mixture but also of translation and transformation into another\n\nregime, or into statements belonging to other regimes; one would look at\n\nwhat passes and does not pass in such a transformation, what remains\n\nirreducible and what flows. Third, one could try to create new, as yet\n\nunknown statements for that proposition, even if the result were a patois\n\nof sensual delight, physical and semiotic systems in shreds, asubjective\n\naffects, signs without signifiance where syntax, semantics, and logic are in\n\ncollapse.

Something is already happening. But what\n\ncomes to pass on the BwO is not exactly the same as how you make yourself\n\none. However, one is included in the other. Hence the two phases set forth\n\nin the preceding letter. _Why two clearly distinguished phases, _when the\n\nsame thing is done in both cases\u2014sewing and flogging? One phase is for the\n\nfabrication of the BwO, the other to make something circulate on it or pass\n\nacross it; the same procedures are nevertheless used in both phases, but\n\nthey must be done over, done twice. What is certain is that the masochist\n\nhas made himself a BwO under such conditions that the BwO can no longer\n\nbe populated by anything but intensities of pain, _pain waves. _It is false to\n\nsay that the masochist is looking for pain but just as false to say that he is\n\nlooking for pleasure in a particularly suspensive or roundabout way. The\n\nmasochist is looking for a type of BwO that only pain can fill, or travel\nover,\n\ndue to the very conditions under which that BwO was constituted. Pains\n\nare populations, packs, modes of king-masochist-in-the-desert that he\n\nengenders and augments. The same goes for the drugged body and intensi-\n\nties of cold, _refrigerator waves. _For each type of BwO, we must ask: (1)\nWhat\n\ntype is it, how is it fabricated, by what procedures and means (predeter-\n\nmining what will come to pass)? (2) What are its modes, what comes to\n\npass, and with what variants and what surprises, what is unexpected and\n\nwhat expected? In short, there is a very special relation of synthesis and\n\nanalysis between a given type of BwO and what happens on it: an _a priori _\n\nsynthesis by which something will necessarily be produced in a given mode\n\n(but what it will be is not known) and an infinite analysis by which what is\n\nproduced on the BwO is already part of that body's production, is already\n\nincluded in the body, is already on it (but at the price of an infinity of\npas-\n\nsages, divisions, and secondary productions).

The body is now nothing more than a set\n\nof valves, locks, floodgates, bowls, or communicating vessels, each with a\n\nproper name: a peopling of the BwO, a Metropolis that has to be managed\n\nwith a whip. What peoples it, what passes across it, what does the blocking?\n\nA BwO is made in such a way that it can be occupied, populated only by\n\nintensities. Only intensities pass and circulate. Still, the BwO is not a\nscene,\n\na place, or even a support upon which something comes to pass. It has noth-\n\ning to do with phantasy, there is nothing to interpret. The BwO causes\n\nintensities to pass; it produces and distributes them in a _spatium _that is\n\nitself intensive, lacking extension. It is not space, nor is it in space; it\nis mat-\n\nter that occupies space to a given degree\u2014to the degree corresponding to\n\nthe intensities produced. It is nonstratified, unformed, intense matter, the\n\nmatrix of intensity, intensity = 0; but there is nothing negative about that\n\nzero, there are no negative or opposite intensities. Matter equals energy.\n\nProduction of the real as an intensive magnitude starting at zero. That is\n\nwhy we treat the BwO as the full egg before the extension of the organism\n\nand the organization of the organs, before the formation of the strata; as the\n\nintense egg defined by axes and vectors, gradients and thresholds, by\n\ndynamic tendencies involving energy transformation and kinematic\n\nmovements involving group displacement, by migrations: all independent\n\nof _accessory forms _because the organs appear and function here only as\n\npure intensities.\n\n7\n\nThe organ changes when it crosses a threshold, when it\n\nchanges gradient. \"No organ is constant as regards either function or posi-\n\ntion, ... sex organs sprout anywhere,... rectums open, defecate and close,\n\n... the entire organism changes color and consistency in split-second\n\nadjustments.\"\n\n8\n\nThe tantric egg.\n\nAfter all, is not Spinoza's _Ethics _the great book of the BwO?

A formal multiplicity of substantial attributes that, as\n\nsuch, constitutes the ontological unity of substance. There is a continuum\n\nof all of the attributes or genuses of intensity under a single substance, and\n\na continuum of the intensities of a certain genus under a single type or\n\nattribute.

The priest cast the triple curse on desire:\n\nthe negative law, the extrinsic rule, and the transcendent ideal. Facing\n\nnorth, the priest said, Desire is lack (how could it not lack what it\ndesires?).\n\nThe priest carried out the first sacrifice, named castration, and all the men\n\nand women of the north lined up behind him, crying in cadence, \"Lack,\n\nlack, it's the common law.\" Then, facing south, the priest linked desire to\n\npleasure. For there are hedonistic, even orgiastic, priests. Desire will be\n\nassuaged by pleasure; and not only will the pleasure obtained silence desire\n\nfor a moment but the process of obtaining it is already a way of interrupting\n\nit, of instantly discharging it and unburdening oneself of it. Pleasure as\ndis-\n\ncharge: the priest carries out the second sacrifice, named masturbation.\n\nThen, facing east, he exclaimed: _Jouissance _is impossible, but impossible  \n_jouissance _is inscribed in desire. For that, in its very impossibility, is\nthe\n\nIdeal, the \"_manque-a-jouir _that is life.\"\n\n10\n\nThe priest carried out the third\n\nsacrifice, phantasy or the thousand and one nights, the one hundred twenty\n\ndays, while the men of the East chanted: Yes, we will be your phantasy, your\n\nideal and impossibility, yours and also our own. The priest did not turn to\n\nthe west. He knew that in the west lay a plane of consistency, but he thought\n\nthat the way was blocked by the columns of Hercules, that it led nowhere\n\nand was uninhabited by people.

That was its modernism. But it retained the essentials; it even\n\nfound new ways of inscribing in desire the negative law of lack, the external\n\nrule of pleasure, and the transcendent ideal of phantasy. Take the interpre-\n\ntation of masochism: when the ridiculous death instinct is not invoked, it is\n\nclaimed that the masochist, like everybody else, is after pleasure but can\n\nonly get it through pain and phantasied humiliations whose function is to\n\nallay or ward off deep anxiety. This is inaccurate; the masochist's suffering\n\nis the price he must pay, not to achieve pleasure, but to untie the\n\npseudobond between desire and pleasure as an extrinsic measure. Pleasure\n\nis in no way something that can be attained only by a detour through suffer-\n\ning; it is something that must be delayed as long as possible because it\ninter-\n\nrupts the continuous process of positive desire. There is, in fact, a joy that\nis\n\nimmanent to desire as though desire were filled by itself and its contempla-\n\ntions, a joy that implies no lack or impossibility and is not measured by\n\npleasure since it is what distributes intensities of pleasure and prevents\n\nthem from being suffused by anxiety, shame, and guilt. In short, the mas-\n\nochist uses suffering as a way of constituting a body without organs and\n\nbringing forth a plane of consistency of desire. That there are other ways,\n\nother procedures than masochism, and certainly better ones, is beside the\n\npoint; it is enough that some find this procedure suitable for them.\n\nTake a masochist who did not undergo psychoanalysis: \"\n\nPROGRAM\n\n. . .\n\nAt night, put on the bridle and attach my hands more tightly, either to the\n\nbit with the chain, or to the big belt right after returning from the bath.\nPut\n\non the entire harness right away also, the reins and thumbscrews, and\n\nattach the thumbscrews to the harness. My penis should be in a metal\n\nsheath. Ride the reins for two hours during the day, and in the evening as\n\nthe master wishes. Confinement for three or four days, hands still tied, the\n\nreins alternately tightened and loosened. The master will never approach\n\nher horse without the crop, and without using it. If the animal should dis-\n\nplay impatience or rebelliousness, the reins will be drawn tighter, the mas-\n\nter will grab them and give the beast a good thrashing.\"\n\n11\n\nWhat is this\n\nmasochist doing? He seems to be imitating a horse, _Equus eroticus, _but\n\nthat's not it. Nor are the horse and the master-trainer or mistress images of\n\nthe mother or father. Something entirely different is going on: a\n\nbecoming-animal essential to masochism. It is a question of forces. The\n\nmasochist presents it this way: _Training axiom_\u2014_destroy the instinctive  \nforces in order to replace them with transmitted forces. _In fact, it is less\na\n\ndestruction than an exchange and circulation (\"what happens to a horse\n\ncan also happen to me\"). Horses are trained: humans impose upon the\n\nhorse's instinctive forces transmitted forces that regulate the former,\n\nselect, dominate, overcode them. The masochist effects an inversion of\n\nsigns: the horse transmits its transmitted forces to him, so that the\n\nmasochist's innate\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)177.png)\n\n0\n\n156 \u25a1\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS?\n\nforces will in turn be tamed. There are two series, the horse's (innate force,\n\nforce transmitted by the human being), and the masochist's (force trans-\n\nmitted by the horse, innate force of the human being). One series explodes\n\ninto the other, forms a circuit with it: an increase in power or a circuit of\n\nintensities. The \"master,\" or rather the mistress-rider, the equestrian,\n\nensures the conversion of forces and the inversion of signs. The masochist\n\nconstructs an entire assemblage that simultaneously draws and fills the\n\nfield of immanence of desire; he constitutes a body without organs or plane\n\nof consistency using himself, the horse, and the mistress. \"Results to be\n\nobtained: that I am kept in continual expectancy of actions and orders, and\n\nthat little by little all opposition is replaced by _a fusion _of my person\nwith\n\nyours. ... Thus at the mere thought of your boots, without even acknowl-\n\nedging it, I must feel fear. In this way, _it will no longer be women's legs\nthat  \nhave an effect on me, _and if it pleases you to command me to receive your\n\ncaresses, when you have had them and if you make me feel them, you will\n\ngive me the imprint of your body as I have never had it before and never\n\nwould have had it otherwise.\"'\n\n2\n\nLegs are still organs, but the boots now only\n\ndetermine a zone of intensity as an imprint or zone on a BwO.\n\nSimilarly, or actually in a different way, it would be an error to interpret\n\ncourtly love in terms of a law of lack or an ideal of transcendence. The\n\nrenunciation of external pleasure, or its delay, its infinite regress,\ntestifies\n\non the contrary to an achieved state in which desire no longer lacks any-\n\nthing but fills itself and constructs its own field of immanence. Pleasure is\n\nan affection of a person or a subject; it is the only way for persons to \"find\n\nthemselves\" in the process of desire that exceeds them; pleasures, even the\n\nmost artificial, are reterritorializations. But the question is precisely\n\nwhether it is necessary to find oneself. Courtly love does not love the self,\n\nany more than it loves the whole universe in a celestial or religious way. It\nis\n\na question of making a body without organs upon which intensities pass,\n\nself and other\u2014not in the name of a higher level of generality or a broader\n\nextension, but by virtue of singularities that can no longer be said to be\nper-\n\nsonal, and intensities that can no longer be said to be extensive. The field\nof\n\nimmanence is not internal to the self, but neither does it come from an\n\nexternal self or a nonself. Rather, it is like the absolute Outside that knows\n\nno Selves because interior and exterior are equally a part of the immanence\n\nin which they have fused. \"Joy\" in courtly love, the exchange of hearts, the\n\ntest or \"assay\": everything is allowed, as long as it is not external to\ndesire or\n\ntranscendent to its plane, or else internal to persons. The slightest caress\n\nmay be as strong as an orgasm; orgasm is a mere fact, a rather deplorable\n\none, in relation to desire in pursuit of its principle. Everything is allowed:\n\nall that counts is for pleasure to be the flow of desire itself, Immanence,\n\ninstead of a measure that interrupts it or delivers it to the three phantoms,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)178.png)\n\n0\n\nHOW\n\nDO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS?

We see in it the formation of a circuit of intensities between\n\nfemale and male energy, with the woman playing the role of the innate or\n\ninstinctive force (Yin) stolen by or transmitted to the man in such a way\n\nthat the transmitted force of the man (Yang) in turn becomes innate, all the\n\nmore innate: an augmentation of powers.\n\n14\n\nThe condition for this circula-\n\ntion and multiplication is that the man not ejaculate. It is not a question of\n\nexperiencing desire as an internal lack, nor of delaying pleasure in order to\n\nproduce a kind of externalizable surplus value, but instead of constituting\n\nan intensive body without organs, Tao, a field of immanence in which\n\ndesire lacks nothing and therefore cannot be linked to any external or tran-\n\nscendent criterion. It is true that the whole circuit can be channeled toward\n\nprocreative ends (ejaculation when the energies are right); that is how Con-\n\nfucianism understood it. But this is true only for one side of the assemblage\n\nof desire, the side facing the strata, organisms, State, family... It is not\n\ntrue for the other side, the Tao side of destratification that draws a plane\nof\n\nconsistency proper to desire. Is the Tao masochistic? Is courtly love Taoist?\n\nThese questions are largely meaningless. The field of immanence or plane\n\nof consistency must be constructed. This can take place in very different\n\nsocial formations through very different assemblages (perverse, artistic,\n\nscientific, mystical, political) with different types of bodies without\n\norgans. It is constructed piece by piece, and the places, conditions, and\n\ntechniques are irreducible to one another. The question, rather, is whether\n\nthe pieces can fit together, and at what price. Inevitably, there will be mon-\n\nstrous crossbreeds. The plane of consistency would be the totality of all\n\nBwO's, a pure multiplicity of immanence, one piece of which may be Chi-\n\nnese, another American, another medieval, another petty perverse, but all\n\nin a movement of generalized deterritorialization in which each person\n\ntakes and makes what she or he can, according to tastes she or he will have\n\nsucceeded in abstracting from a Self _[Moi], _according to a politics or\nstrat-\n\negy successfully abstracted from a given formation, according to a given\n\nprocedure abstracted from its origin.\n\nWe distinguish between: (1) BwO's, which are different types, genuses,\n\nor substantial attributes. For example, the Cold of the drugged BwO, the\n\nPain of the masochist BwO.

There are a number of questions. Not only\n\nhow to make oneself a BwO, and how to produce the corresponding\n\nintensities without which it would remain empty (not exactly the same\n\nquestion). But also how to reach the plane of consistency. How to sew up,\n\ncool down, and tie together all the BwO's. If this is possible to do, it is\nonly\n\nby conjugating the intensities produced on each BwO, by producing a con-\n\ntinuum of all intensive continuities. Are not assemblages necessary to fab-\n\nricate each BwO, is not a great abstract Machine necessary to construct the\n\nplane of consistency? Gregory Bateson uses the term _plateau _for continu-\n\nous regions of intensity constituted in such a way that they do not allow\n\nthemselves to be interrupted by any external termination, any more than\n\nthey allow themselves to build toward a climax; examples are certain sex-\n\nual, or aggressive, processes in Balinese culture.\n\n15\n\nA plateau is a piece of\n\nimmanence. Every BwO is made up of plateaus. Every BwO is itself a pla-\n\nteau in communication with other plateaus on the plane of consistency.\n\nThe BwO is a component of passage.\n\nA rereading of _H'eliogabale _and _Les Tarahumaras. _For Heliogabalus is\n\nSpinoza, and Spinoza is Heliogabalus revived. And the Tarahumaras are\n\nexperimentation, peyote. Spinoza, Heliogabalus, and experimentation\n\nhave the same formula: anarchy and unity are one and the same thing, not\n\nthe unity of the One, but a much stranger unity that applies only to the mul-\n\ntiple.\n\n16\n\nThese two books by Artaud express the multiplicity of fusion,\n\nfusionability as infinite zero, the plane of consistency, Matter where no\n\ngods go; principles as forces, essences, substances, elements, remissions,\n\nproductions; manners of being or modalities as produced intensities,\n\nvibrations, breaths, Numbers. Finally, the difficulty of reaching this world\n\nof crowned Anarchy if you go no farther than the organs (\"the liver that\n\nturns the skin yellow, the brain wracked by syphilis, the intestines that\n\nexpel filth\") and if you stay locked into the organism, or into a stratum that\n\nblocks the flows and anchors us in this, our world.\n\nWe come to the gradual realization that the BwO is not at all the opposite\n\nof the organs. The organs are not its enemies. The enemy is the organism.\n\nThe BwO is opposed not to the organs but to that organization of the organs\n\ncalled the organism. It is true that Artaud wages a struggle against the\n\norgans, but at the same time what he is going after, what he has it in for, is\n\nthe organism: _The body is the body. Alone it stands.

The organism is already\n\nthat, the judgment of God, from which medical doctors benefit and on\n\nwhich they base their power. The organism is not at all the body, the BwO;\n\nrather, it is a stratum on the BwO, in other words, a phenomenon of accu-\n\nmulation, coagulation, and sedimentation that, in order to extract useful\n\nlabor from the BwO, imposes upon it forms, functions, bonds, dominant\n\nand hierarchized organizations, organized transcendences. The strata are\n\nbonds, pincers. \"Tie me up if you wish.\" We are continually stratified. But\n\nwho is this we that is not me, for the subject no less than the organism\n\nbelongs to and depends on a stratum? Now we have the answer: the BwO is\n\nthat glacial reality where the alluvions, sedimentations, coagulations,\n\nfoldings, and recoilings that compose an organism\u2014and also a significa-\n\ntion and a subject\u2014occur. For the judgment of God weighs upon and is\n\nexercised against the BwO; it is the BwO that undergoes it. It is in the BwO\n\nthat the organs enter into the relations of composition called the organism.\n\nThe BwO howls: \"They've made me an organism! They've wrongfully\n\nfolded me! They've stolen my body!\" The judgment of God uproots it from\n\nits immanence and makes it an organism, a signification, a subject. It is the\n\nBwO that is stratified. It swings between two poles, the surfaces of stratifi-\n\ncation into which it is recoiled, on which it submits to the judgment, and\n\nthe plane of consistency in which it unfurls and opens to experimentation.\n\nIf the BwO is a limit, if one is forever attaining it, it is because behind\neach\n\nstratum, encasted in it, there is always another stratum. For many a stra-\n\ntum, and not only an organism, is necessary to make the judgment of God.\n\nA perpetual and violent combat between the plane of consistency, which\n\nfrees the BwO, cutting across and dismantling all of the strata, and the sur-\n\nfaces of stratification that block it or make it recoil.\n\nLet us consider the three great strata concerning us, in other words, the\n\nones that most directly bind us: the organism, signifiance, and\n\nsubjectifi-cation. The surface of the organism, the angle of signifiance and\n\ninterpretation, and the point of subjectification or subjection. You will be\n\norganized, you will be an organism, you will articulate your\n\nbody\u2014otherwise you're just depraved. You will be signifier and\n\nsignified, interpreter and interpreted\u2014otherwise you're just a deviant.\n\nYou will be a subject, nailed down as one, a subject of the enunciation\n\nrecoiled into a subject of the statement\u2014otherwise you're just a tramp.\n\nTo the strata as a whole, the BwO opposes disarticulation (or _n _\n\narticulations) as the property of the plane of consistency, experimentation\n\nas the operation on that plane (no signifier, never interpret!), and\n\nnomadism as the movement (keep moving, even in place, never stop\n\nmoving, motionless voyage, desubjectification).

And how\n\nnecessary caution is, the art of dosages, since overdose is a danger. You\n\ndon't do it with a sledgehammer, you use a very fine file. You invent\n\nself-destructions that have nothing to do with the death drive. Dismantling\n\nthe organism has never meant killing yourself, but rather opening the body\n\nto connections that presuppose an entire assemblage, circuits,\n\nconjunctions, levels and thresholds, passages and distributions of\n\nintensity, and territories and deterritorializations measured with the craft\n\nof a surveyor. Actually, dismantling the organism is no more difficult\n\nthan dismantling the other two strata, signifiance and subjectification.\n\nSignifiance clings to the soul just as the organism clings to the body, and\n\nit is not easy to get rid of either. And how can we unhook ourselves from\n\nthe points of subjectification that secure us, nail us down to a dominant\n\nreality? Tearing the conscious away from the subject in order to make it a\n\nmeans of exploration, tearing the unconscious away from signifiance and\n\ninterpretation in order to make it a veritable production: this is assuredly\n\nno more or less difficult than tearing the body away from the organism.\n\nCaution is the art common to all three; if in dismantling the organism there\n\nare times one courts death, in slipping away from signifiance and subjection\n\none courts falsehood, illusion and hallucination and psychic death. Artaud\n\nweighs and measures every word: the conscious \"knows what is good for it\n\nand what is of no value to it: it knows which thoughts and feelings it can\n\nreceive without danger and with profit, and which are harmful to the\n\nexercise of its freedom. Above all, it knows just how far its own being\n\ngoes, and just how far it has not yet gone or does not have the right to go\n\nwithout sinking into the unreal, the illusory, the unmade, the unprepared ...\n\na _Plane _which normal consciousness does not reach but which _Ciguri _\n\nallows us to reach, and which is the very mystery of all poetry. But there is\n\nin human existence another plane, obscure and formless, where\n\nconsciousness has not entered, and which surrounds it like an\n\nunilluminated extension or a menace, as the case may be. And which itself\n\ngives off adventurous sensations, perceptions. These are those shameless\n\nfantasies which affect an unhealthy conscious. ... I too have had false\n\nsensations and perceptions and I have believed in them.\"\n\n18\n\nYou have to keep enough of the organism for it to reform each dawn; and\n\nyou have to keep small supplies of signifiance and subjectification, if only\n\nto turn them against their own systems when the circumstances demand it,\n\nwhen things, persons, even situations, force you to; and you have to keep\n\nsmall rations of subjectivity in sufficient quantity to enable you to respond\n\nto the dominant reality.

There are, in fact, several ways of botching\n\nthe BwO: either one fails to produce it, or one produces it more or less, but\n\nnothing is produced on it, intensities do not pass or are blocked. This is\n\nbecause the BwO is always swinging between the surfaces that stratify it\n\nand the plane that sets it free. If you free it with too violent an action, if\nyou\n\nblow apart the strata without taking precautions, then instead of drawing\n\nthe plane you will be killed, plunged into a black hole, or even dragged\n\ntoward catastrophe. Staying stratified\u2014organized, signified, subjected\u2014\n\nis not the worst that can happen; the worst that can happen is if you throw\n\nthe strata into demented or suicidal collapse, which brings them back down\n\non us heavier than ever. This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a\n\nstratum, experiment with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous\n\nplace on it, find potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines\n\nof flight, experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try\n\nout continuums of intensities segment by segment, have a small plot of new\n\nland at all times. It is through a meticulous relation with the strata that\none\n\nsucceeds in freeing lines of flight, causing conjugated flows to pass and\n\nescape and bringing forth continuous intensities for a BwO. Connect, con-\n\njugate, continue: a whole \"diagram,\" as opposed to still signifying and sub-\n\njective programs. We are in a social formation; first see how it is stratified\n\nfor us and in us and at the place where we are; then descend from the strata\n\nto the deeper assemblage within which we are held; gently tip the assem-\n\nblage, making it pass over to the side of the plane of consistency. It is only\n\nthere that the BwO reveals itself for what it is: connection of desires, con-\n\njunction of flows, continuum of intensities. You have constructed your\n\nown little machine, ready when needed to be plugged into other collective\n\nmachines. Castaneda describes a long process of experimentation (it\n\nmakes little difference whether it is with peyote or other things): let us\n\nrecall for the moment how the Indian forces him first to find a \"place,\"\n\nalready a difficult operation, then to find \"allies,\" and then gradually to\n\ngive up interpretation, to construct flow by flow and segment by segment\n\nlines of experimentation, becoming-animal, becoming-molecular, etc. For\n\nthe BwO is all of that: necessarily a Place, necessarily a Plane, necessarily\na\n\nCollectivity (assembling elements, things, plants, animals, tools, people,\n\npowers, and fragments of all of these; for it is not \"my\" body without\n\norgans, instead the \"me\" _(moi) _is on it, or what remains of me, unalterable\n\nand changing in form, crossing thresholds).\n\nIn the course of Castaneda's books, the reader may begin to doubt the\n\nexistence of the Indian Don Juan, and many other things besides.

The fourth book, _Tales of Power, _is about\n\nthe living distinction between the \"Tonal\" and the \"Nagual.\" The _tonal _\n\nseems to cover many disparate things: It is the organism, and also all that is\n\norganized and organizing; but it is also signifiance, and all that is\nsignifying\n\nor signified, all that is susceptible to interpretation, explanation, all that\nis\n\nmemorizable in the form of something recalling something else; finally, it\n\nis the Self _(Moi), _the subject, the historical, social, or individual\nperson,\n\nand the corresponding feelings. In short, the tonal is everything, including\n\nGod, the judgment of God, since it \"makes up the rules by which it appre-\n\nhends the world. So, in a manner of speaking, it creates the world.\"\n\n19\n\nYet\n\nthe tonal is only an island. For the _nagual _is also everything. And it is\nthe\n\nsame everything, but under such conditions that the body without organs\n\nhas replaced the organism and experimentation has replaced all interpreta-\n\ntion, for which it no longer has any use. Flows of intensity, their fluids,\ntheir\n\nfibers, their continuums and conjunctions of affects, the wind, fine\n\nsegmentation, microperceptions, have replaced the world of the subject.\n\nBecomings, becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, have replaced his-\n\ntory, individual or general. In fact, the tonal is not as disparate as it\nseems:\n\nit includes all of the strata and everything that can be ascribed to the\nstrata,\n\nthe organization of the organism, the interpretations and explanations of\n\nthe signifiable, the movements of subjectification. The nagual, on the con-\n\ntrary, dismantles the strata. It is no longer an organism that functions but a\n\nBwO that is constructed. No longer are there acts to explain, dreams or\n\nphantasies to interpret, childhood memories to recall, words to make sig-\n\nnify; instead, there are colors and sounds, becomings and intensities (and\n\nwhen you become-dog, don't ask if the dog you are playing with is a dream\n\nor a reality, if it is \"your goddam mother\" or something else entirely). There\n\nis no longer a Self _[Moi] _that feels, acts, and recalls; there is \"a glowing\nfog, a\n\ndark yellow mist\" that has affects and experiences movements, speeds.\n\n20\n\nThe important thing is not to dismantle the tonal by destroying it all of a\n\nsudden. You have to diminish it, shrink it, clean it, and that only at certain\n\nmoments. You have to keep it in order to survive, to ward off the assault of\n\nthe nagual. For a nagual that erupts, that destroys the tonal, a body without\n\norgans that shatters all the strata, turns immediately into a body of noth-\n\ningness, pure self-destruction whose only outcome is death: \"The tonal\n\nmust be protected at any cost.\"\n\n21\n\nWe still have not answered the question of why there are so many dan-\n\ngers, and so many necessary precautions.

Even if\n\nwe consider given social formations, or a given stratic apparatus within a\n\nformation, we must say that every one of them has a BwO ready to gnaw,\n\nproliferate, cover, and invade the entire social field, entering into\nrelations\n\nof violence and rivalry as well as alliance and complicity. A BwO of money\n\n(inflation), but also a BwO of the State, army, factory, city, Party, etc. If\nthe\n\nstrata are an affair of coagulation and sedimentation, all a stratum needs is\n\na high sedimentation rate for it to lose its configuration and articulations,\n\nand to form its own specific kind of tumor, within itself or in a given forma-\n\ntion or apparatus. The strata spawn their own BwO's, totalitarian and fas-\n\ncist BwO's, terrifying caricatures of the plane of consistency. It is not\n\nenough to make a distinction between full BwO's on the plane of consis-\n\ntency and empty BwO's on the debris of strata destroyed by a too-violent\n\ndestratification. We must also take into account cancerous BwO's in a stra-\n\ntum that has begun to proliferate. _The three-body problem. _Artaud said that\n\noutside the \"plane\" is another plane surrounding us with \"an\n\nunillu-minated extension or a menace, as the case may be.\" It is a struggle\n\nand as such is never sufficiently clear. How can we fabricate a BwO for\n\nourselves without its being the cancerous BwO of a fascist inside us, or\n\nthe empty BwO of a drug addict, paranoiac, or hypochondriac? How can\n\nwe tell the three Bodies apart? Artaud was constantly grappling with this\n\nproblem. The extraordinary composition of _To Be Done with the  \nJudgment of God: _he begins by cursing the cancerous body of America,\n\nthe body of war and money; he denounces the strata, which he calls\n\n\"caca\"; to the strata he opposes the true Plane, even if it is only peyote,\n\nthe little trickle of the Tarahumaras; but he also knows about the dangers\n\nof a too-sudden, careless destratification. Artaud was constantly grappling\n\nwith all of that, and flowed with it. _Letter to Hitler: _\"Dear Sir, In 1932\nin the\n\nIder Cafe in Berlin, on one of the evenings when I made your acquaintance\n\nand shortly before you took power, I showed you roadblocks on _a map that  \nwas not just a map of geography, _roadblocks against me, an act of force\n\naimed in a certain\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)185.png)\n\n0\n\n164 \u25a1\n\nHOW DO YOU MAKE YOURSELF A BODY WITHOUT ORGANS?\n\nnumber of directions you indicated to me.

Be it under-\n\nstood, dear sir, that this is hardly an invitation, it is above all a\nwarning.\"\n\n22\n\nThat map that is not only a map of geography is something like a BwO\n\nintensity map, where the roadblocks designate thresholds and the gas,\n\nwaves or flows. Even if Artaud did not succeed for himself, it is certain that\n\nthrough him something has succeeded for us all.\n\nThe BwO is the egg. But the egg is not regressive; on the contrary, it is\n\nperfectly contemporary, you always carry it with you as your own milieu of\n\nexperimentation, your associated milieu. The egg is the milieu of pure\n\nintensity, spatium not extension, Zero intensity as principle of production.\n\nThere is a fundamental convergence between science and myth, embryol-\n\nogy and mythology, the biological egg and the psychic or cosmic egg: the egg\n\nalways designates this intensive reality, which is not undifferentiated, but\n\nis where things and organs are distinguished solely by gradients, migra-\n\ntions, zones of proximity. The egg is the BwO. The BwO is not \"before\" the\n\norganism; it is adjacent to it and is continually in the process of construct-\n\ning itself. If it is tied to childhood, it is not in the sense that the adult\n\nregresses to the child and the child to the Mother, but in the sense that the\n\nchild, like the Dogon twin who takes a piece of the placenta with him, tears\n\nfrom the organic form of the Mother an intense and destratified matter\n\nthat on the contrary constitutes his or her perpetual break with the past, his\n\nor her present experience, experimentation. The BwO is a childhood block,\n\na becoming, the opposite of a childhood memory. It is not the child\n\n\"before\" the adult, or the mother \"before\" the child: it is the strict contem-\n\nporaneousness of the adult, of the adult and the child, their map of compar-\n\native densities and intensities, and all of the variations on that map. The\n\nBwO is precisely this intense germen where there are not and cannot be\n\neither parents or children (organic representation). This is what Freud\n\nfailed to understand about Weissmann: the child as the germinal contem-\n\nporary of its parents. Thus the BwO is never yours or mine. It is always _a _\n\nbody. It is no more projective than it is regressive. It is an involution, but\n\nalways a contemporary, creative involution. The organs distribute them-\n\nselves on the BwO, but they distribute themselves independently of the\n\nform of the organism; forms become contingent, organs are no longer any-\n\nthing more than intensities that are produced, flows, thresholds, and gradi-\n\nents. \"A\" stomach, \"an\" eye, \"a\" mouth: the indefinite article does not lack\n\nanything; it is not indeterminate or undifferentiated, but expresses the\n\npure determination of intensity, intensive difference. The indefinite arti-\n\ncle is the conductor of desire. It is not at all a question of a fragmented,\n\nsplintered body, of organs without the body (OwB). The BwO is exactly the\n\nopposite.

There is a distribution of intensive principles of\n\norgans, with their positive indefinite articles, within a collectivity or\n\nmultiplicity, inside an assemblage, and according to machinic\n\nconnections operating on a BwO. _Logos spermaticos. _The error of\n\npsychoanalysis was to understand BwO phenomena as regressions,\n\nprojections, phantasies, in terms of an _image _of the body. As a result, it\n\nonly grasps the flipside of the BwO and immediately substitutes family\n\nphotos, childhood memories, and part-objects for a worldwide intensity\n\nmap. It understands nothing about the egg nor about indefinite articles\n\nnor about the contemporaneousness of a continually self-constructing\n\nmilieu.\n\nThe BwO is desire; it is that which one desires and by which one de-\n\nsires. And not only because it is the plane of consistency or the field of\n\nimmanence of desire. Even when it falls into the void of too-sudden\n\ndestra-tification, or into the proliferation of a cancerous stratum, it is\nstill\n\ndesire. Desire stretches that far: desiring one's own annihilation, or\n\ndesiring the power to annihilate. Money, army, police, and State desire,\n\nfascist desire, even fascism is desire. There is desire whenever there is the\n\nconstitution of a BwO under one relation or another. It is a problem not of\n\nideology but of pure matter, a phenomenon of physical, biological,\n\npsychic, social, or cosmic matter. That is why the material problem\n\nconfronting schizoanalysis is knowing whether we have it within our means\n\nto make the selection, to distinguish the BwO from its doubles: empty\n\nvitreous bodies, cancerous bodies, totalitarian and fascist. The test of\ndesire:\n\nnot denouncing false desires, but distinguishing within desire between that\n\nwhich pertains to stratic proliferation, or else too-violent destratification,\n\nand that which pertains to the construction of the plane of consistency\n\n(keep an eye out for all that is fascist, even inside us, and also for the\n\nsuicidal and the demented). The plane of consistency is not simply that\n\nwhich is constituted by the sum of all BwO's. There are things it rejects;\n\nthe BwO chooses, as a function of the abstract machine that draws it.\n\nEven within a BwO (the masochist body, the drugged body, etc.), we\n\nmust distinguish what can be composed on the plane and what cannot.\n\nThere is a fascist use of drugs, or a suicidal use, but is there also a\npossible\n\nuse that would be in conformity with the plane of consistency? Even\n\nparanoia: Is there a possibility of using it that way in part? When we\n\nasked the question of the totality of all BwO's, considered as substantial\n\nattributes of a single substance, it should have been understood, strictly\n\nspeaking, to apply only to the plane. The plane is the totality of the full\n\nBwO's that have been selected (there is no positive totality including the\n\ncancerous or empty bodies). What is the nature of this totality?

Year Zero: Faciality\n\nEarlier, we encountered two axes, signifiance and subjectification. We saw  \nthat they were two very different semiotic systems, or even two strata.  \nSignifiance is never without a white wall upon which it inscribes its signs  \nand redundancies. Subjectification is never without a black hole in which  \nit lodges its consciousness, passion, and redundancies. Since all semiotics  \nare mixed and strata come at least in twos, it should come as no surprise  \nthat a very special mechanism is situated at their intersection. Oddly  \nenough, it is a face: the _white wall/black hole _system. A broad face with  \nwhite cheeks, a chalk face with eyes cut in for a black hole. Clown head,  \nwhite clown, moon-white mime, angel of death, Holy Shroud. The face is  \nnot an envelope exterior to the person who speaks, thinks, or feels. The  \nform of the signifier in language, even its units, would remain indetermi-  \nnate if the potential listener did not use the face of the speaker to guide\nhis  \nor her choices (\"Hey, he seems angry ...\"; \"He couldn't say it...\"; \"You  \nsee my face when I'm talking to you ...\"; \"look at me carefully...\").

The face itself is redundancy. It is itself in redundancy\n\nwith the redundancies of signifiance or frequency, and those of resonance\n\nor subjectivity. The face constructs the wall that the signifier needs in\norder\n\nto bounce off of; it constitutes the wall of the signifier, the frame or\nscreen.\n\nThe face digs the hole that subjectification needs in order to break through;\n\nit constitutes the black hole of subjectivity as consciousness or passion, the\n\ncamera, the third eye.\n\nOr should we say things differently? It is not exactly the face that consti-\n\ntutes the wall of the signifier or the hole of subjectivity. The face, at\nleast the\n\nconcrete face, vaguely begins to take shape _on _the white wall. It vaguely\n\nbegins to appear _in _the black hole.

According to this\n\naccount, the dimensionless black hole and formless white wall are already\n\nthere to begin with. And there are already a number of possible combina-\n\ntions in the system: either black holes distribute themselves on the white\n\nwall, or the white wall unravels and moves toward a black hole combining\n\nall black holes, hurtling them together or making them \"crest.\" Sometimes\n\nfaces appear on the wall, with their holes; sometimes they appear in the\n\nhole, with their linearized, rolled-up wall. A horror story, the face is a\nhor-\n\nror story.

(2) Lewin's discovery of a _white screen\n_\n\nof the dream, which is ordinarily covered by visual contents but remains\n\nwhite when the only dream contents are proprioceptive sensations (this\n\nscreen or white wall, once again, is the breast as it approaches, getting\n\nlarger and then pressing flat). (3) Spitz's interpretation according to which\n\nthe white screen, rather than being a representation of the breast itself as\nan\n\nobject of tactile sensation or contact, is a visual percept implying a mini-\n\nmum of distance and upon which the mother's face appears for the child to\n\nuse as a guide in finding the breast. Thus there is a combination of two very\n\ndifferent kinds of elements: manual, buccal, or cutaneous proprioceptive\n\nsensations; and the visual perception of the face seen from the front against\n\nthe white screen, with the shape of the eyes drawn in for black holes.

This system should under no cir-\n\ncumstances be confused with the volume-cavity system proper to the\n\n(proprioceptive) body. The head is included in the body, but the face is not.\n\nThe face is a surface: facial traits, lines, wrinkles; long face, square face,\ntri-\n\nangular face; the face is a map, even when it is applied to and wraps a vol-\n\nume, even when it surrounds and borders cavities that are now no more\n\nthan holes. The head, even the human head, is not necessarily a face. The\n\nface is produced only when the head ceases to be a part of the body, when it\n\nceases to be coded by the body, when it ceases to have a multidimensional,\n\npolyvocal corporeal code\u2014when the body, head included, has been\n\ndecoded and has to be _overcoded_'by something we shall call the Face. This\n\namounts to saying that the head, all the volume-cavity elements of the\n\nhead, have to be facialized. What accomplishes this is the screen with holes,\n\nthe white wall/black hole, the abstract machine producing faciality. But the\n\noperation does not end there: if the head and its elements are facialized, the\n\nentire body also can be facialized, comes to be facialized as part of an\ninevi-\n\ntable process. When the mouth and nose, but first the eyes, become a holey\n\nsurface, all the other volumes and cavities of the body follow. An operation\n\nworthy of Doctor Moreau: horrible and magnificent. Hand, breast, stom-\n\nach, penis and vagina, thigh, leg and foot, all come to be facialized. Fetish-\n\nism, erotomania, etc., are inseparable from these processes of\n\nfacializa-tion. It is not at all a question of taking a part of the body and\n\nmaking it _resemble _a face, or making a dream-face dance in a cloud. No\n\nanthropomorphism here. Facialization operates not by resemblance but by\n\nan order of reasons. It is a much more unconscious and machinic\n\noperation that draws the entire body across the holey surface, and in which\n\nthe role of the face is not as a model or image, but as an overcoding of all\n\nof the decoded parts. Everything remains sexual; there is no sublimation,\n\nbut there are new coordinates. _It is precisely because the face depends on  \nan abstract machine that it is not content to cover the head, _but touches all\n\nother parts of the body, and even, if necessary, other objects without\n\nresemblance. _The question then becomes what circumstances trigger the  \nmachine _that produces the face and facialization. Although the head, even\n\nthe human head, is not necessarily a face, the face is produced in\n\nhumanity. But it is produced by a necessity that does not apply to human\n\nbeings \"in general.\" The face is not animal, but neither is it human in\n\ngeneral; there is even something absolutely inhuman about the face.

When the novel began, with Chretien\n\nde Troyes, for example, the essential character that would accompany it\n\nover the entire course of its history was already there: The knight of the\n\nnovel of courtly love spends his time forgetting his name, what he is doing,\n\nwhat people say to him, he doesn't know where he is going or to whom he is\n\nspeaking, he is continually drawing a line of absolute deterritorialization,\n\nbut also losing his way, stopping, and falling into black holes. \"He awaits\n\nchivalry and adventure.\" Open Chretien de Troyes to any page and you will\n\nfind a catatonic knight seated on his steed, leaning on his lance, waiting,\n\nseeing the face of his loved one in the landscape; you have to hit him to\n\nmake him respond. Lancelot, in the presence of the queen's white face,\n\ndoesn't notice his horse plunge into the river; or he gets into a passing cart\n\nand it turns out to be the cart of disgrace.

And each of the\n\ntwo terms reterritorializes on the other. Reterritorialization must not be\n\nconfused with a return to a primitive or older territoriality: it necessarily\n\nimplies a set of artifices by which one element, itself deterritorialized,\n\nserves as a new territoriality for another, which has lost its territoriality\nas\n\nwell. Thus there is an entire system of horizontal and complementary\n\nreter-ritorializations, between hand and tool, mouth and breast, face and\n\nlandscape. _Second theorem: _The fastest of two elements or movements of\n\ndeterritorialization is not necessarily the most intense or most deterri-\n\ntorialized. Intensity of deterritorialization must not be confused with\n\nspeed of movement or development. The fastest can even connect its inten-\n\nsity to the slowest, which, as an intensity, does not come after the fastest\nbut\n\nis simultaneously at work on a different stratum or plane (for example, the\n\nway the breast-mouth relation is guided from the start by a plane of\n\nfaciality). _Third theorem: _It can even be concluded from this that the\n_least _\n\ndeterritorialized reterritorializes on the _most _deterritorialized.

We have seen that the deterritorialization of the head into a\n\nface is absolute but remains negative in that it passes from one stratum to\n\nanother, from the stratum of the organism to those of signifiance and\n\nsubjectification. The hand and breast reterritorialize on the face and in the\n\nlandscape: they are facialized at the same time as they are landscapified.\n\nEven a use-object may come to be facialized: you might say that a house,\n\nutensil, or object, an article of clothing, etc., is _watching me, _not\nbecause it\n\nresembles a face, but because it is taken up in the white wall/black hole\n\nprocess, because it connects to the abstract machine of facialization. The\n\nclose-up in film pertains as much to a knife, cup, clock, or kettle as to a\nface\n\nor facial element, for example, Griffith's \"the kettle is watching me.\" Is it\n\nnot fair to say, then, that there are close-ups in novels, as when Dickens\n\nwrites the opening line of _The Cricket on the Hearth: _\"The kettle began\n\nit. . .\",\n\n10\n\nand in painting, when a utensil becomes a face-landscape from\n\nwithin, or when a cup on a tablecloth or a teapot is facialized, in Bonnard,\n\nVuillard? _Fourth theorem: _The abstract machine is therefore effectuated\n\nnot only in the faces that produce it but also to varying degrees in body\n\nparts, clothes, and objects that it facializes following an order of reasons\n\n(rather than an organization of resemblances).\n\nYet the question remains: When does the abstract machine of faciality\n\nenter into play? When is it triggered? Take some simple examples: the\n\nmaternal power operating through the face during nursing; the passional\n\npower operating through the face of the loved one, even in caresses; the\n\npolitical power operating through the face of the leader (streamers, icons,\n\nand photographs), even in mass actions; the power of film operating\n\nthrough the face of the star and the close-up; the power of television. It is\n\nnot the individuality of the face that counts but the efficacy of the cipher-\n\ning it makes possible, and in what cases it makes it possible. This is an\naffair\n\nnot of ideology but of economy and the organization of power _(pouvoir). _\n\nWe are certainly not saying that the face, the power of the face _(la\npuissance  \ndu visage), _engenders and explains social power _(pouvoir). Certain assem-  \nblages of power (pouvoir) require the production of a face, _others do not. If\n\nwe consider primitive societies, we see that there is very little that\noperates\n\nthrough the face: their semiotic is nonsignifying, nonsubjective, essentially\n\ncollective, polyvocal, and corporeal, playing on very diverse forms and\n\nsubstances.

Doubtless, there are profound\n\nmovements of deterritorialization that shake up the coordinates of the\n\nbody and outline particular assemblages of power; however, they connect\n\nthe body not to faciality but to becomings-animal, in particular with the\n\nhelp of drugs.

Shaman, warrior, and hunter organizations of\n\npower, fragile and precarious, are all the more spiritual by virtue of the\n\nfact that they operate through corporeality, animality, and vegetality. When\n\nwe said earlier that the human head still belongs to the stratum of the\n\norganism, we obviously were not denying the existence of culture and\n\nsociety among these peoples; we were merely saying that these cultures'\n\nand societies' codes pertain to bodies, to the belonging of heads to bodies,\n\nto the ability of the body-head system to _become _and receive souls, and to\n\nreceive them as friends while repulsing enemy souls. \"Primitives\" may\n\nhave the most human of heads, the most beautiful and most spiritual, but\n\nthey have no face and need none.\n\nThe reason is simple.

Under the first aspect, the\n\nblack hole acts as a central computer, Christ, the third eye that moves\n\nacross the wall or the white screen serving as general surface of reference.\n\nRegardless of the content one gives it, the machine constitutes a facial unit,\n\nan elementary face in biunivocal relation with another: it is a man _or _a\n\nwoman, a rich person or a poor one, an adult or a child, a leader or a\nsubject,\n\n\"an x _or _a y.\" The movement of the black hole across the screen, the trajec-\n\ntory of the third eye over the surface of reference, constitutes so many\n\ndichotomies or arborescences, like four-eye machines made of elementary\n\nfaces linked together two by two. The face of a teacher and a student, father\n\nand son, worker and boss, cop and citizen, accused and judge (\"the judge\n\nhad a stern expression, his eyes were horizonless...\"): concrete individu-\n\nalized faces are produced and transformed on the basis of these units, these\n\ncombinations of units\u2014like the face of a rich child in which a military call-\n\ning is already discernible, that West Point chin. You don't so much have a\n\nface as slide into one.\n\nUnder the second aspect, the abstract machine of faciality assumes a\n\nrole of selective response, or choice: given a concrete face, the machine\n\njudges whether it passes or not, whether it goes or not, on the basis of the\n\nelementary facial units. This time, the binary relation is of the \"yes-no\"\n\ntype. The empty eye or black hole absorbs or rejects, like a half-doddering\n\ndespot who can still give a signal of acquiescence or refusal. The face of a\n\ngiven teacher is contorted by tics and bathed in an anxiety that makes it \"no\n\ngo.\" A defendant, a subject, displays an overaffected submission that turns\n\ninto insolence. Or someone is too polite to be honest. A given face is neither\n\na man's nor a woman's. Or it is neither a poor person's nor a rich person's.\n\nIs it someone who lost his fortune? At every moment, the machine rejects\n\nfaces that do not conform, or seem suspicious. But only at a given level of\n\nchoice. For it is necessary to produce successive divergence-types of devi-\n\nance for everything that eludes biunivocal relationships, and to establish\n\nbinary relations between what is accepted on first choice and what is only\n\ntolerated on second, third choice, etc. The white wall is always expanding,\n\nand the black hole functions repeatedly. The teacher has gone mad, but\n\nmadness is a face conforming to the \u00abth choice (not the last, however, since\n\nthere are mad faces that do not conform to what one assumes madness\n\nshould be). A ha! It's not a man and it's not a woman, so it must be a\n\ntrans-vestite: The binary relation is between the \"no\" of the first category\n\nand the \"yes\" of the following category, which under certain conditions may\n\njust as easily mark a tolerance as indicate an enemy to be mowed down at all\n\ncosts.

They are also inscribed on the wall, distributed by the  \nhole. They must be Christianized, in other words, facialized.

From the viewpoint of racism, there is no exterior,\nthere  \nare no people on the outside. There are only people who should be like us  \nand whose crime it is not to be. The dividing line is not between inside  \nand outside but rather is internal to simultaneous signifying chains and  \nsuccessive subjective choices. Racism never detects the particles of the  \nother; it propagates waves of sameness until those who resist  \nidentification have been wiped out (or those who only allow themselves to  \nbe identified at a given degree of divergence). Its cruelty is equaled only by  \nits incompetence and naivete.\n\nOn the brighter side, painting has exploited all the resources of the\n\nChrist-face. Painting has taken the abstract white wall/black hole machine  \nof faciality in all directions, using the face of Christ to produce every kind  \nof facial unit and every degree of deviance. In this respect, there is an  \nexultation in the painting of the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, like an  \nunbridled freedom. Not only did Christ preside over the facialization of  \nthe entire body (his own) and the landscapification of all milieus (his own),  \nbut he composed all of the elementary faces and had every divergence at his  \ndisposal: Christ-athlete at the fair, Christ-Mannerist queer, Christ-Negro,  \nor at least a Black Virgin at the edge of the wall.

Second, the picking of a combination\n\ndepends on a certain number _of subjective _binary choices that increase pro-\n\nportionally to the number of elements. But the problem is that all of this\n\nbiunivocalization and binarization (which is not just the result of an\n\nincrease in calculating skills, as some say) assumes the deployment of a wall\n\nor screen, the installation of a central computing hole without which no\n\nmessage would be discernible and no choice could be implemented. The\n\nblack hole/white wall system must already have gridded all of space and\n\noutlined its arborescences or dichotomies for those of signifier and\n\nsubjectification even to be conceivable. The mixed semiotic of signifiance\n\nand subjectification has an exceptional need to be protected from any\n\nintrusion from the outside. In fact, there must not be any exterior: no\n\nnomad machine, no primitive poly vocality must spring up, with their com-\n\nbinations of heterogeneous substances of expression. Translatability of\n\nany kind requires a single substance of expression. One can constitute sig-\n\nnifying chains operating with deterritorialized, digitalized, discrete ele-\n\nments only if there is a semiological screen available, a wall to protect\n\nthem. One can make subjective choices between two chains or at each point\n\nin a chain only if no outside tempest sweeps away the chains and subjects.\n\nOne can form a web of subjectivities only if one possesses a central eye, a\n\nblack hole capturing everything that would exceed or transform either the\n\nassigned affects or the dominant significations. Moreover, it is absurd to\n\nbelieve that language as such can convey a message. A language is always\n\nembedded in the faces that announce its statements and ballast them in\n\nrelation to the signifiers in progress and subjects concerned. Choices are\n\nguided by faces, elements are organized around faces: a common grammar\n\nis never separable from a facial education. The face is a veritable mega-\n\nphone. Thus not only must the abstract machine of faciality provide a pro-\n\ntective screen and a computing black hole; in addition, the faces it\n\nproduces draw all kinds of arborescences and dichotomies without which\n\nthe signifying and the subjective would not be able to make the arbor-\n\nescences and dichotomies function that fall within their purview in lan-\n\nguage. Doubtless, the binarities and biunivocalities of the face are not the\n\nsame as those of language, of its elements and subjects. There is no resem-\n\nblance between them.

Facial biunivocalities and\n\nbina-rities double the others; facial redundancies are in redundancy with\n\nsignifying and subjective redundancies. It is precisely because the face\n\ndepends on an abstract machine that it does not assume a preexistent\n\nsubject or signifier; but it is subjacent to them and provides the substance\n\nnecessary to them. What chooses the faces is not a subject, as in the\n\nSzondi test; it is faces that choose their subjects. What interprets the\n\nblack blotch/white hole figure, or the white page/black hole, is not a\n\nsignifier, as in the Rorschach test; it is that figure which programs the\n\nsignifiers.\n\nWe have made some progress toward answering the question of what\n\ntriggers the abstract machine of faciality, for it is not in operation all the\n\ntime or in just any social formation. _Certain _social formations need face,\n\nand also landscape.\n\n13\n\nThere is a whole history behind it. At very different\n\ndates, there occurred a generalized collapse of all of the heterogeneous,\n\npolyvocal, primitive semiotics in favor of a semiotic of signifiance and\n\nsubjectification. Whatever the differences between signifiance and\n\nsubjec-tification, whichever prevails over the other in this case or that,\n\nwhatever the varying figures assumed by their de facto mixtures\u2014they\n\nhave it in common to crush all polyvocality, set up language as a form of\n\nexclusive expression, and operate by signifying biunivocalization and\n\nsubjective binarization. The superlinearity proper to language is no\n\nlonger coordinated with multidimensional figures: it now flattens out all\n\nvolumes and subordinates all lines. Is it by chance that linguistics always,\n\nand very quickly, encounters the problem of homonymy, or ambiguous\n\nstatements that it then subjects to a set of binary reductions? More\n\ngenerally, linguistics can tolerate no poly vocality or rhizome traits: a\nchild\n\nwho runs around, plays, dances, and draws cannot concentrate attention\n\non language and writing, and will never be a good subject. In short, the\n\nnew semiotic needs systematically to destroy the whole range of primitive\n\nsemiotic systems, even if it retains some of their debris in well-defined\n\nenclosures.\n\nHowever, there is more to the picture than semiotic systems waging war\n\non one another armed only with their own weapons. _Very specific assem-  \nblages of power impose signifiance and subjectification _as their determinate\n\nform of expression, in reciprocal presupposition with new contents: there\n\nis no signifiance without a despotic assemblage, no subjectification with-\n\nout an authoritarian assemblage, and no mixture between the two without\n\nassemblages of power that act through signifiers and act upon souls and\n\nsubjects.

Either the mask\n\nassures the head's belonging to the body, its becoming-animal, as was the\n\ncase in primitive societies. Or, as is the case now, the mask assures the\nerec-\n\ntion, the construction of the face, the facialization of the head and the\n\nbody: the mask is now the face itself, the abstraction or operation of the\n\nface.

The order is totally different: despotic and authoritar-\n\nian concrete assemblage of power \u2014\u25ba triggering of the abstract machine of\n\nfaciality, white wall/black hole \u2014&gt; installation of the new semiotic of\n\nsignifiance and subjectification on that holey surface. That is why we have\n\nbeen addressing just two problems exclusively: the relation of the face to\n\nthe abstract machine that produces it, and the relation of the face to the\n\nassemblages of power that require that social production.

Neither begins with Christ, or the White\n\nMan as Christian universal: there are Indian, African, and Asiatic despotic\n\nformations of signifiance; the authoritarian process of subjectification\n\nappears most purely in the destiny of the Jewish people. But however dif-\n\nferent these semiotics are, they still form a de facto _mix, _and it is at the\nlevel\n\nof this mixture that they assert their imperialism, in other words, their\n\ncommon endeavor to crush all other semiotics. There is no signifiance that\n\ndoes not harbor the seeds of subjectivity; there is no subjectification that\n\ndoes not drag with it remnants of signifier. If the signifier bounces above\nall\n\noff a wall, if subjectivity spins above all toward a hole, then we must say\nthat\n\nthe wall of the signifier already includes holes and the black hole of subjec-\n\ntivity already carries scraps of wall. The mix, therefore, has a solid founda-\n\ntion in the indissociable white wall/black hole machine, and the two\n\nsemiotics intermingle through intersection, splicing, and the plugging of\n\none into the other, as with the \"Hebrew and the Pharaoh.\" But there is more\n\nbecause the nature of the mixtures may vary greatly. If it is possible to\n\nassign the faciality machine a date\u2014the year zero of Christ and the histori-\n\ncal development of the White Man\u2014it is because that is when the mixture\n\nceased to be a splicing or an intertwining, becoming a total\n\ninterpene-tration in which each element suffuses the other like drops of\n\nred-black wine in white water. Our semiotic of modern White Men, the\n\nsemiotic of capitalism, has attained this state of mixture in which\n\nsignifiance and subjectification effectively interpenetrate. Thus it is in\n\nthis semiotic that faciality, or the white wall/black hole system, assumes\n\nits full scope. We must, however, assess the states of mixture and the\n\nvarying proportions of the elements. Whether in the Christian or\n\npre-Christian state, one element may dominate another, one may be more\n\nor less powerful than the other. We are thus led to define _limit-faces, _\n\nwhich are different from both the facial units and the degrees of facial\n\ndivergence previously defined.\n\n1\\. The black hole is on the white wall.

The landscape will be populated with eyes\n\nor black holes, as in an Ernst painting, or a drawing by Aloi'se or Wolfli.\nCir-\n\ncles are drawn around a hole on the white wall; an eye can be placed in each\n\nof the circles. We can even propose the following law: the more circles there\n\nare around a hole, the more the bordering effect acts to increase the surface\n\nover which the hole slides and to give that surface a force of capture.

It is still a multiplicity but\nconstitutes a\n\ndifferent figure of destiny: reflexive, passional, subjective destiny. It is\nthe  \n_maritime _face or landscape: it follows the line separating the sky from the\n\nwaters, or the land from the waters. This authoritarian face is in profile and\n\nspins toward the black hole. Or else there are two faces facing each other,\n\nbut in profile to the observer, and their union is already marked by a limit-\n\nless separation. Or else the faces turn away from each other, swept away by\n\nbetrayal. Tristan, Isolde, Isolde, Tristan, in the boat carrying them to the\n\nblack hole of betrayal and death. A faciality of consciousness and passion, a\n\nredundancy of resonance and coupling. This time, the effect of the close-up\n\nis no longer to expand a surface while simultaneously closing it off; its only\n\nfunction is to have an anticipatory temporal value. It marks the origin of a\n\nscale of intensity, or is part of that scale; the closer the faces get to the\nblack\n\nhole as termination point, the more the close-up heats the line they follow.\n\nEisenstein's close-ups versus Griffith's (the intensive heightening of\n\nshame, or anger, in the close-ups in _Potemkin)._\n\n_15_\n\n_ _Here again, it is clear that\n\nany combination is possible between the two limit-figures of the face. In\n\nPabst's _Lulu, _the despotic face of the fallen Lulu is associated with the\n\nimage of a bread knife, which has the anticipatory value of foreshadowing\n\nthe murder; but the authoritarian face of Jack the Ripper also ascends a\n\nwhole scale of intensities leading to the knife and Lulu's murder.\n\nMore generally, we may note characteristics common to the two\n\nlimit-figures. First, although the white wall, the broad cheeks, is the\n\nsubstantial element of the signifier, and the black hole the reflexive element\n\nof subjectivity, they always go together. But in one of two modes: either\n\nthe black holes distribute themselves and multiply on the white wall, or\n\nthe wall, reduced to its crest or horizon thread, hurtles toward a black\n\nhole that crests them all. There is no wall without black holes, and no\n\nblack hole without a wall. Second, in both cases the black hole is\n\nnecessarily surrounded by a border, or even bordered more than once: the\n\neffect of this border is either to expand the surface of the wall or to\nintensify\n\nthe line. The black hole is never in the eyes (pupil); it is always inside the\n\nborder, and the eyes are always inside the hole: dead eyes, which see all the\n\nbetter for being in a black hole.\n\n16\n\nThese common characteristics do not\n\npreclude the existence of a limit-difference between the two figures of the\n\nface, and proportions according to which first one then the other\n\ndominates in the mixed semiotic. The terrestrial signifying despotic face,\n\nthe maritime subjective passional authoritarian face (the desert can also be\n\na sea of land). Two figures of destiny, two states of the faciality machine.\n\nJean Paris has clearly shown how these poles operate in painting, the pole\n\nof the despotic Christ and that of the passional Christ: on the one hand,\n\nthe face of Christ seen from the front, as in a Byzantine mosaic, with the\n\nblack hole of the eyes\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)206.png)\n\nYEAR ZERO: FACIALITY D 185\n\nagainst a gold background, all depth projected forward; and on the other\n\nhand, faces that cross glances and turned away from each other, seen\n\nhalf-turned or in profile, as in a quattrocento painting, their sidelong\n\nglances drawing multiple lines, integrating depth into the painting itself\n\n(arbitrary examples of transition and mixture can be cited, such a\n\nDuccio's _Calling of Saint Peter and Saint Andrew, _against the background of\n\nan aquatic landscape; the second formula has already overtaken Christ and\n\nthe first fisherman, while the second fisherman remains within the Byzantine\n\ncode).\n\n17\n\nCelebatory Machine\n\nMaritime Subjective Authoritarian Face (after Tristan and Isolde)\n\n_Swann's Love: _Proust was able to make the face, landscape, painting,\n\nmusic, etc., resonate together.

A piece of music must let fall a little phrase that\n\nconnects with Odette's face, to the point that the little phrase becomes only\n\na signal. The white wall becomes populous, the black holes are arrayed.\n\nThis entire mechanism of signifiance, with its referral of interpretations,\n\nprepares the way for the second, passional subjective, moment, during\n\nwhich Swann's jealousy, querulous delusion, and erotomania develop.\n\nNow Odette's face races down a line hurtling toward a single black hole,\n\nthat of Swann's Passion. The other lines, of landscapity, picturality, and\n\nmusicality, also rush toward this catatonic hole and coil around it, border-\n\ning it several times.\n\nBut in the third moment, at the end of his long passion, Swann attends a\n\nreception where he sees the faces of the servants and guests _disaggregate _\n\ninto autonomous aesthetic traits, as if the line of picturality regained its\n\nindependence, both beyond the wall and outside the black hole. Then\n\nVinteuil's little phrase regains its transcendence and renews its connection\n\nwith a still more intense, asignifying, and asubjective line of pure musi-\n\ncality. And Swann knows that he no longer loves Odette and, above all, that\n\nOdette will never again love him.\n\nWas this salvation through art necessary? For neither Swann nor Proust\n\nwas saved. Was it necessary to break through the wall and out of the hole in  \n_this _way, by renouncing love? Was not that love rotten from the start, made\n\nof signifiance and jealousy? Was it possible to do anything else, considering\n\nOdette's mediocrity and Swann's aestheticism? In a way, the madeleine is\n\nthe same story. The narrator munches his madeleine: redundancy, the\n\nblack hole of involuntary memory. How can he get out of that? And it is,\n\nabove all, something one has to get out of, escape from. Proust knows that\n\nquite well, even if his commentators do not. But the way he gets out is\n\nthrough art, uniquely through art.\n\nHow do you get out of the black hole? How do you break through the\n\nwall? How do you dismantle the face? Whatever genius there may be in the\n\nFrench novel, that is not its affair. It is too concerned with measuring the\n\nwall, or even with building it, with plumbing the depths of black holes and\n\ncomposing faces. The French novel is profoundly pessimistic and idealis-\n\ntic, \"critical of life rather than creative of life.\" It stuffs its characters\ndown\n\nthe hole and bounces them off the wall. It can only conceive of organized\n\nvoyages, and of salvation only through art, a still Catholic salvation, in\n\nother words, salvation through eternity. It spends its time plotting points\n\ninstead of drawing lines, active lines of flight or of positive\n\ndeterritori-alization. The Anglo-American novel is totally different. \"To\n\nget away. To get away, out!...

That is why their relationship\nto\n\nother civilizations, to the Orient or South America, and also to drugs and\n\nvoyages in place, is entirely different from that of the French. They know\n\nhow difficult it is to get out of the black hole of subjectivity, of\nconscious-\n\nness and memory, of the couple and conjugality.

Madness is a definite danger: Is it\n\nby chance that schizos lose their sense of the face, their own and others',\n\ntheir sense of the landscape, and the sense of language and its dominant sig-\n\nnifications all at the same time? The organization of the face is a strong\n\none. We could say that the face holds within its rectangle or circle a whole\n\nset of traits, _faciality traits, _which it subsumes and places at the service\nof\n\nsignifiance and subjectification. What is a tic? It is precisely the continu-\n\nally refought battle between a faciality trait that tries to escape the sover-\n\neign organization of the face and the face itself, which clamps back down\n\non the trait, takes hold of it again, blocks its line of flight, and reimposes\nits\n\norganization upon it. (There is a medical distinction between the clonic or\n\nconvulsive tic and the tonic or spasmodic tic; perhaps we can say that in the\n\nfirst case the faciality trait that is trying to escape has the upper hand,\n\nwhereas in the second case the facial organization that is trying to clamp\n\nback down or immobilize itself has the upper hand.) But if dismantling the\n\nface is a major affair, it is because it is not simply a question of tics, or\nan\n\namateur's or aesthete's adventure. If the face is a politics, dismantling the\n\nface is also a politics involving real becomings, an entire\n\nbecoming-clandestine. Dismantling the face is the same as breaking\n\nthrough the wall of the signifier and getting out of the black hole of\n\nsubjectivity.

We will\n\nalways be failures at playing African or Indian, even Chinese, and no voy-\n\nage to the South Seas, however arduous, will allow us to cross the wall, get\n\nout of the hole, or lose our face. We will never succeed in making ourselves a\n\nnew primitive head and body, human, spiritual, and faceless. It would only\n\nbe taking more photos and bouncing off the wall again. We will always find\n\nourselves reterritorialized again. O my little desert island, on you I am in\n\nthe Closerie des Lilas again, O my deep ocean, you reflect the lake in the\n\nBois de Boulogne, O little phrase of Vinteuil, you recall a sweet moment.\n\nThese are Eastern physical and spiritual exercises, but for a couple, like a\n\nconjugal bed tucked with a Chinese sheet: you did do your exercises today,\n\ndidn't you?

The white wall of the signifier, the black\n\nhole of subjectivity, and the facial machine are impasses, the measure of\n\nour submissions and subjections; but we are born into them, and it is there\n\nwe must stand battle. Not in the sense of a necessary stage, but in the sense\n\nof a tool for which a new use must be invented. Only across the wall of the\n\nsignifier can you run lines of asignifiance that void all memory, all return,\n\nall possible signification and interpretation. Only in the black hole of\n\nsubjective consciousness and passion do you discover the transformed,\n\nheated, captured particles you must relaunch for a nonsubjective, living\n\nlove in which each party connects with unknown tracts in the other without\n\nentering or conquering them, in which the lines composed are broken lines.\n\nOnly on your face and at the bottom of your black hole and upon your white\n\nwall will you be able to set faciality traits free like birds, not in order to\n\nreturn to a primitive head, but to invent the combinations by which those\n\ntraits connect with landscapity traits that have themselves been freed from\n\nthe landscape and with traits of picturality and musicality that have also\n\nbeen freed from their respective codes. With what joy the painters used the\n\nface of Christ himself, taking it in every sense and direction; and it was not\n\nsimply the joy of a desire to paint, but the joy of all desires.

Each freed faciality trait forms a rhizome with a freed trait of\n\nlandscapity, picturality, or musicality. This is not a collection of\n\npart-objects but a living block, a connecting of stems by which the traits\n\nof a face enter a real multiplicity or diagram with a trait of an unknown\n\nlandscape, a trait of painting or music that is thereby effectively produced,\n\ncreated, according to quanta of absolute, positive\n\ndeterritori-alization\u2014not evoked or recalled according to systems of\n\nreterritorializa-tion.

Something is always going to happen,\n\ncome to pass. Something always happens in the novel also, but the novel\n\nintegrates elements of the novella and the tale into the variation of its\n\nperpetual living present _(duration). _The detective novel is a particularly\n\nhybrid genre in this respect, since most often the something = Xthat has\n\nhappened is on the order of a murder or theft, but exactly what it is that has\n\nhappened remains to be discovered, and in the present determined by the\n\nmodel detective. Yet it would be an error to reduce these different aspects\n\nto the three dimensions of time. Something happened, something is going\n\nto happen, can designate a past so immediate, a future so near, that they are\n\none (as Husserl would say) with retentions and protentions of the present\n\n192\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)214.png)\n\n0\n\n1874:\n\nTHREE NOVELLAS, OR \"WHAT HAPPENED?\" \u25a1 193\n\nitself. Nevertheless, the distinction is legitimate, in view of the different\n\nmovements that animate the present, are contemporaneous with it: One\n\nmoves with it, another already casts it into the past _from the moment _it is\n\npresent (novella), while another _simultaneously _draws it into the future\n\n(tale). We are lucky to have treatments of the same subject by a tale writer\n\nand a novella writer: two lovers, one of whom dies suddenly in the other's\n\nroom. In Maupassant's tale, \"Une ruse\" (An artifice), everything revolves\n\naround these questions: What is going to happen? How will the survivor\n\nextricate himself from the situation? What will the third party-savior, in\n\nthis case a doctor, think of? In Barbey d'Aurevilly's novella, \"Le rideau\n\ncramoisi\" (The crimson curtain), everything revolves around: Something\n\nhappened, but what? That is the question, not only because it is really not\n\nknown what the cold young woman just died from, but also because it will\n\nnever be known why she gave herself to the petty officer, or how the third\n\nparty-savior, here the colonel of the regiment, was able to arrange things.\n\n1\n\nIt\n\nshould not be thought that it is easier to leave things open-ended: for there\n\nto be something that has happened that we will never know about, or even\n\nseveral things in a row, requires no less minute attention and precision than\n\nthe contrary case, when the author must invent the details of what will need\n\nto be known. You will never know what just happened, or you will always\n\nknow what is going to happen: these are the reasons for the reader's two\n\nbated breaths, in the novella and the tale, respectively, and they are two\n\nways in which the living present is divided at every instant. In the novella,\n\nwe do not wait for something to happen, we expect something to have just\n\nhappened. The novella is a last novella, whereas the tale is a first tale. The\n\n\"presence\" of the tale writer is completely different from that of the novella\n\nwriter (and both are different from that of the novelist). Let us not dwell\ntoo\n\nmuch on the dimensions of time: the novella has little to do with a memory\n\nof the past or an act of reflection; quite to the contrary, it plays upon a\nfun-\n\ndamental forgetting. It evolves in the element of \"what happened\" because\n\nit places us in a relation with something unknowable and imperceptible\n\n(and not the other way around: it is not because it speaks of a past about\n\nwhich it can no longer provide us knowledge). It may even be that nothing\n\nhas happened, but it is precisely that nothing that makes us say, Whatever\n\ncould have happened to make me forget where I put my keys, or whether I\n\nmailed that letter, etc.? What little blood vessel in my brain could have rup-\n\ntured? What is this nothing that makes something happen? The novella has\n\na fundamental relation to _secrecy _(not with a secret matter or object to be\n\ndiscovered, but with the form of the secret, which remains impenetrable),\n\nwhereas the tale has a relation to _discovery _(the form of discovery,\nindepen-\n\ndent of what can be discovered). The novella also enacts _postures _of the\n\nbody and mind that are like folds or envelopments, whereas the tale puts\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)215.png)\n\n0\n\n194 \u25a1\n\n1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR \"WHAT HAPPENED?\"\n\ninto play _attitudes or positions _that are like unfoldings and developments,\n\nhowever unexpected. Barbey has an evident fondness for body posture, in\n\nother words, states of the body when it is surprised by something that just\n\nhappened. In the preface to the _Diaboliques, _Barbey even suggests that\n\nthere is a diabolism of body postures, a sexuality, pornography, and\n\nscatol-ogy of postures quite different from those that also, and\n\nsimultaneously, mark body attitudes or positions. Posture is like inverse\n\nsuspense. Thus it is not a question of saying that the novella relates to the\n\npast and the tale to the future; what we should say instead is that the\nnovella\n\nrelates, in the present itself, to the formal dimension of something that has\n\nhappened, even if that something is nothing or remains unknowable.\n\nSimilarly, one should not try to make the distinction between the novella\n\nand the tale coincide with categories such as the fantastic, the fabulous,\n\netc.; that is another problem, there is no reason why it should overlap. The\n\nlinks of the novella are: What happened? (the modality or expression),\n\nSecrecy (the form), Body Posture (the content).\n\nTake Fitzgerald. He is a tale and novella writer of genius. He is a novella\n\nwriter when he asks himself, _Whatever could have happened for things to  \nhave come to this? He _is the only one who has been able to carry this ques-\n\ntion to such a point of intensity. It is not a question of memory, reflection,\n\nold age, or fatigue, whereas the tale would deal with childhood, action, or\n\nimpulse. Yet it is true that Fitzgerald only asks himself the question of the\n\nnovella writer when he is personally worn-out, fatigued, sick, or even worse\n\noff. But once again, there is not necessarily a connection: it can also be a\n\nquestion of vigor, or love. It still is, even in desperate conditions. It is\nbetter\n\nto think of it as an affair of perception: you enter a room and perceive\n\nsomething as already there, as just having happened, even though it has not\n\nyet been done. Or you know that what is in the process of happening is hap-\n\npening for the last time, it's already over with. You hear an \"I love you\" you\n\nknow is the last one. Perceptual semiotics. God, whatever could have hap-\n\npened, even though everything is and remains imperceptible, and in order\n\nfor everything to be and remain imperceptible forever?\n\nNot only is there a specificity of the novella, but there is also a specific\n\nway in which the novella treats a universal matter. For we are made of lines.\n\nWe are not only referring to lines of writing. Lines of writing conjugate with\n\nother lines, life lines, lines of luck or misfortune, lines productive of the\n\nvariation of the line of writing itself, lines that are _between the lines _of\nwrit-\n\ning. Perhaps the novella has its own way of giving rise to and combining\n\nthese lines, which nonetheless belong to everyone and every genre.\n\nVladimir Propp has said, with great solemnity, that the folktale must be\n\ndefined in terms of external and internal _movements _that it qualifies, for-\n\nmalizes, and combines in its own specific way.\n\n2\n\nWe would like to demon-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)216.png)\n\n0\n\n1874:\n\nTHREE NOVELLAS, OR \"WHAT HAPPENED?\" D 195\n\nstrate that the novella is defined by living _lines, _flesh lines, about which\nit\n\nbrings a special revelation. Marcel Arland is correct to say that the novella\n\n\"is nothing but pure lines right down to the nuances, _and _nothing but the\n\npure and conscious power of the word.\"\n\n3\n\n**First Novella: \"In the Cage,\" Henry James**\n\nThe heroine, a young telegrapher, leads a very clear-cut, calculated life pro-\n\nceeding by delimited segments: the telegrams she takes one after the other,\n\nday after day; the people to whom she sends the telegrams; their social class\n\nand the different ways they use telegraphy; the words to be counted. More-\n\nover, her telegraphist's cage is like a contiguous segment to the grocery\n\nstore next door, where her fiance works. Contiguity of territories. And the\n\nfiance is constantly plotting out their future, work, vacations, house. Here,\n\nas for all of us, there is a line of rigid segmentarity on which everything\n\nseems calculable and foreseen, the beginning and end of a segment, the pas-\n\nsage from one segment to another. Our lives are made like that: Not only\n\nare the great molar aggregates segmented (States, institutions, classes), but\n\nso are people as elements of an aggregate, as are feelings as relations\n\nbetween people; they are segmented, not in such a way as to disturb or dis-\n\nperse, but on the contrary to ensure and control the identity of each agency,\n\nincluding personal identity. The fiance can say to the young woman, Even\n\nthough there are differences between our segments, we have the same tastes\n\nand we are alike. I am a man, you are a woman; you are a telegraphist, I am a\n\ngrocer; you count words, I weigh things; our segments fit together, conju-\n\ngate. Conjugality. A whole interplay of well-determined, well-planned ter-\n\nritories. They have a future but no becoming. This is the first life line, the  \n_molar or rigid line of segmentarity; _in no sense is it dead, for it occupies\nand\n\npervades our life, and always seems to prevail in the end. It even includes\n\nmuch tenderness and love. It would be too easy to say, \"This is a bad line,\"\n\nfor you find it everywhere, and in all the other lines.\n\nA rich couple comes into the post office and reveals to the young woman,\n\nor at least confirms, the existence of another life: coded, multiple tele-\n\ngrams, signed with pseudonyms. It is hard to tell who is who anymore, or\n\nwhat anything means. Instead of a rigid line composed of well-determined\n\nsegments, telegraphy now forms a supple flow marked by _quanta _that are\n\nlike so many little segmentations-in-progress grasped at the moment of\n\ntheir birth, as on a moonbeam, or on an intensive scale. Thanks to her \"pro-\n\ndigious talent for interpretation,\" the young woman grasps that the man\n\nhas a secret that has placed him in danger, deeper and deeper in danger, in a\n\ndangerous posture. It does not just have to do with his love relations with\n\nthe woman.

Now what counts is the form of the  \nsecret; the matter no longer even has to be discovered (we never find out,  \nthere are several possibilities, there is an objective indetermination, a kind  \nof molecularization of the secret). In relation to this man, directly with  \nhim, the young telegraphist develops a strange passional complicity, a  \nwhole intense molecular life that does not even enter into rivalry with the  \nlife she leads with her fiance. What has happened, whatever could have  \nhappened? This life, however, is not in her head, it is not imaginary. Rather,  \nwe should say that there are _two politics _involved, as the young woman sug-  \ngests in a remarkable conversation with her fiance: a macropohtics and a  \nmicropolitics that do not envision classes, sexes, people, or feelings in at\nall  \nthe same way. Or again, there are two very different types of relations:  \nintrinsic relations of _couples _involving well-determined aggregates or ele-  \nments (social classes, men and women, this or that particular person), and  \nless localizable relations that are always external to themselves and instead  \nconcern flows and particles eluding those classes, sexes, and persons. Why  \nare the latter relations _of doubles _rather than of couples? \"She was\nliterally  \nafraid of the alternate self who might be waiting outside. He might be wait-  \ning; it was he who was her alternate self, and of him she was afraid.\"\n\n4\n\nIn any\n\ncase, this line is very different from the previous one; it is a _line of\nmolecu-  \nlar or supple segmentation _the segments of which are like quanta of  \ndeterritorialization. It is on this line that a present is defined whose very  \nform is the form of something that has already happened, however close  \nyou might be to it, since the ungraspable matter of that something is  \nentirely molecularized, traveling at speeds beyond the ordinary thresholds  \nof perception. Yet we will not say that it is necessarily better.\n\nThere is no question that the two lines are constantly interfering, react-\n\ning upon each other, introducing into each other either a current of supple-  \nness or a point of rigidity. Nathalie Sarraute, in her essay on the novel,  \npraises English novelists, not only for discovering (as did Proust and  \nDostoyevsky) the great movements, territories, and points of the uncon-  \nscious that allow us to regain time or revive the past, but also for  \ninopportunely following these molecular lines, simultaneously present and  \nimperceptible. She shows that dialogue or conversation does indeed com-  \nply with the breaks of a fixed segmentarity, with vast movements of regu-  \nlated distribution corresponding to the attitudes and positions of each of  \nus; but also that they are run through and swept up by _micromovements,  \n_fine segmentations distributed in an entirely different way, unfindable par-  \nticles of an anonymous matter, tiny cracks and postures operating by dif-  \nferent agencies even in the unconscious, secret lines of disorientation or\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)218.png)\n\n0\n\n1874:\n\nTHREE NOVELLAS, OR \"WHAT HAPPENED?\" \u25a1 197\n\ndeterritorialization: as she puts it, a whole subconversation within conver-\n\nsation, in other words, a micropolitics of conversation.\n\n5\n\nThen James's heroine reaches a sort of maximum quantum in her sup-\n\nple segmentarity or line of flow beyond which she cannot go (even if she\n\nwanted to, there is no going further). There is a danger that these vibrations\n\ntraversing us may be aggravated beyond our endurance. What happened?\n\nThe molecular relation between the telegraphist and the telegraph sender\n\ndissolved in the form of the secret\u2014because nothing happened. Each of\n\nthem is propelled toward a rigid segmentarity: he will marry the\n\nnow-widowed lady, she will marry her fiance. And yet everything has\n\nchanged. She has reached something like a new line, a third type, a kind\n\nof _line of flight _that is just as real as the others even if it occurs in\nplace:\n\nthis line no longer tolerates segments; rather, it is like an exploding of the\n\ntwo segmentary series. She has broken through the wall, she has gotten out\n\nof the black holes. She has attained a kind of absolute deterritorialization.\n\n\"She ended up knowing so much that she could no longer interpret any-\n\nthing. _There were no longer shadows to help her see more clearly, only  \nglare.\"_\n\n_6_\n\n_ _You cannot go further in life than this sentence by James. The\n\nnature of the secret has changed once again. Undoubtedly, the secret\n\nalways has to do with love, and sexuality. But previously it was either only a\n\nhidden matter given in the past (the better hidden the more ordinary it\n\nwas), and we did not exactly know what form to give it: See, I am bending\n\nunder the burden of my secret, see what mystery resides within me. It was a\n\nway of seeming interesting, what D. H. Lawrence called \"the dirty little\n\nsecret,\" _my _Oedipus, in a way. Or else the secret became the form of some-\n\nthing whose matter was molecularized, imperceptible, unassignable: not a\n\ngiven of the past but the ungivable \"What happened?\" But on this third line\n\nthere is no longer even any form\u2014nothing but a pure abstract line. It is\n\nbecause we no longer have anything to hide that we can no longer be appre-\n\nhended. To become imperceptible oneself, to have dismantled love in\n\norder to become capable of loving. To have dismantled one's self in order\n\nfinally to be alone and meet the true double at the other end of the line. A\n\nclandestine passenger on a motionless voyage. To become like everybody\n\nelse; but this, precisely, is a becoming only for one who knows how to be\n\nnobody, to no longer be anybody. To paint oneself gray on gray. As\n\nKierkegaard says, nothing distinguishes the knight of the faith from a bour-\n\ngeois German going home or to the post office: he sends off no special tele-\n\ngraphic sign; he constantly produces or reproduces finite segments, yet he\n\nis already moving on a line no one even suspects.\n\n7\n\nIn any case, the tele-\n\ngraphic line is not a symbol, and it is not simple. There are at least three\nof\n\nthem: a line of rigid and clear-cut segmentarity; a line of molecular\n\nsegmentarity; and an abstract line, a line of flight no less deadly and no\nless\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)219.png)\n\n0\n\n198 \u25a1\n\n1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR \"WHAT HAPPENED?\"\n\nalive than the others. On the first line, there are many words and conversa-\n\ntions, questions and answers, interminable explanations, precisions; the\n\nsecond is made of silences, allusions, and hasty innuendos inviting\n\ninterpretation. But if the third line flashes, if the line of flight is like a\ntrain\n\nin motion, it is because one jumps linearly on it, one can finally speak\n\n\"literally\" of anything at all, a blade of grass, a catastrophe or sensation,\n\ncalmly accepting that which occurs when it is no longer possible for any-\n\nthing to stand for anything else. The three lines, however, continually\n\nintermingle.\n\n**Second Novella: \"The **\n\n**Crack-up,\" F. Scott Fitzgerald**\n\nWhat happened? This is the question Fitzgerald keeps coming back to\n\ntoward the end, having remarked that \"of course all life is a process of\n\nbreaking down.\"\n\n8\n\nHow should we understand this \"of course\"? We can say,\n\nfirst of all, that life is always drawn into an increasingly rigid and desic-\n\ncated segmentarity. For the writer Fitzgerald, voyages, with their clear-cut\n\nsegments, had lost their usefulness. There was also, from segment to seg-\n\nment, the depression, loss of wealth, fatigue and growing old, alcoholism,\n\nthe failure of conjugality, the rise of the cinema, the advent of fascism and\n\nStalinism, and the loss of success and talent\u2014at the very moment\n\nFitzgerald would find his genius. \" _The big sudden blows that come, or seem  \nto come, from outside\" _(p. 69), and proceed by oversignificant _breaks, _mov-\n\ning us from one term to the other according to successive binary \"choices\":\n\nrich/poor... Even when change runs in the other direction, there is nothing\n\nto compensate for the rigidification, the aging that overcodes everything\n\nthat occurs. This is a line of rigid segmentarity bringing masses into play,\n\neven if it was supple to begin with.\n\nBut Fitzgerald says that there is another type of cracking, with an en-\n\ntirely different segmentarity. Instead of great breaks, these are\n\nmicro-cracks, as in a dish; they are much more subtle and supple, and _occur  \nwhen things are going well on the other side. _If there is aging on this line,\nit is\n\nnot of the same kind: when you age on this line you don't feel it on the\n\nother line, you don't notice it on the other line until after \"it\" has already\n\nhappened on this line. At such a moment, which does not correspond to any\n\nof the ages of the other line, you reach a degree, a quantum, an intensity\n\nbeyond which you cannot go. (It's a very delicate business, these\n\nintensities: the finest intensity becomes harmful if it overtaxes your\n\nstrength at a given moment; you have to be able to take it, you have to be in\n\nshape.)

The crack-up \"happens almost without your knowing it\n\nbut is realized suddenly indeed\" (p. 69). This molecular line, more supple\n\nbut no less disquieting, in fact, much more disquieting, is not simply inter-\n\nnal or personal: it also brings everything into play, but on a different scale\n\nand in different forms, with segmentations of a different nature,\n\nrhizomatic instead of arborescent. A micropolitics.\n\nThere is, in addition, a third line, which is like a line of rupture or a\n\n\"clean break\" and marks the exploding of the other two, their shake-up...\n\nin favor of something else? \"This led me to the idea that the ones who had\n\nsurvived had made some sort of clean break. This is a big word and is no\n\nparallel to a jailbreak when one is probably headed for a new jail or will be\n\nforced back to the old one\" (p. 81). Here, Fitzgerald contrasts rupture with\n\nstructural pseudobreaks in so-called signifying chains. But he also distin-\n\nguishes it from more supple, more subterranean links or stems of the \"voy-\n\nage\" type, or even from molecular conveyances. \"The famous 'Escape' or\n\n'run away from it all' is an excursion in a trap even if the trap includes the\n\nSouth Seas, which are only for those who want to paint them or sail them. A\n\nclean break is something you cannot come back from; that is irretrievable\n\nbecause it makes the past cease to exist\" (p. 81). Can it be that voyages are\n\nalways a return to rigid segmentarity? Is it always your daddy and mommy\n\nthat you meet when you travel, even as far away as the South Seas, like\n\nMelville? Hardened muscles? Must we say that supple segmentarity itself\n\nreconstructs the great figures it claimed to escape, but under the micro-\n\nscope, in miniature? Beckett's unforgettable line is an indictment of all\n\nvoyages: \" _We don't travel for the fun of it, as far as I know; we're\nfoolish, but  \nnot that foolish.\"_\n\nIn rupture, not only has the matter of the past volitized; the form of what\n\nhappened, of an imperceptible something that happened in a volatile mat-\n\nter, no longer even exists. One has become imperceptible and clandestine\n\nin motionless voyage. Nothing can happen, or can have happened, any\n\nlonger. Nobody can do anything for or against me any longer. My territories\n\nare out of grasp, not because they are imaginary, but the opposite: because I\n\nam in the process of drawing them. Wars, big and little, are behind me. Voy-\n\nages, always in tow to something else, are behind me. I no longer have any\n\nsecrets, having lost my face, form, and matter. I am now no more than a\n\nline. I have become capable of loving, not with an abstract, universal love,\n\nbut a love I shall choose, and that shall choose me, blindly, my double, just\n\nas selfless as I.

What they\n\nwatch for are the movements, outbursts, infractions, disturbances, and\n\nrebellions occurring in the abyss. But there is a major difference between\n\nthe two types of lookouts. The near-seers have a simple spyglass. In the\n\nabyss, they see the outline of gigantic cells, great binary divisions,\ndichoto-\n\nmies, well-defined segments of the type \"classroom, barracks, low-income\n\nhousing project, or even countryside seen from an airplane.\" They see\n\nbranches, chains, rows, columns, dominoes, striae.

There are very few of them, at most one\n\nper segment. Their telescopes are complex and refined. But they are in no\n\nway leaders. And what they see is entirely different from what the others\n\nsee. They see a whole microsegmentarity, details of details, \"a roller\n\ncoaster of possibilities,\" tiny movements that have not reached the edge,\n\nlines or vibrations that start to form long before there are outlined shapes,\n\n\"segments that move by jerks.\" A whole rhizome, a molecular\n\nsegmentarity that does not permit itself to be overcoded by a signifier\n\nlike the cutting machine, or even to be attributed to a given figure, a given\n\naggregate or element. This second line is inseparable from the anonymous\n\nsegmentation that produces it and challenges everything all the time,\n\nwithout goal or reason: \"What happened?\" The far-seers can divine the\n\nfuture, but always in the form of a becoming of something that has already\n\nhappened in a molecular matter; unfindable particles. The situation is the\n\nsame in biology: the great cellular divisions and dichotomies, with their\n\ncontours, are accompanied by migrations, invaginations, displacements,\n\nand morphogenetic impulses whose segments are marked not by\n\nlocalizable points but by thresholds of intensity passing underneath,\n\nmitoses that scramble everything, and molecular lines that intersect each\n\nother within the large-scale cells and between their breaks. The situation is\n\nthe same in a society: rigid segments and overcutting segments are\n\ncrosscut underneath by segmentations of another nature. But this is\n\nneither one nor the other, neither biology nor a society; nor is it a\n\nresemblance between the two: \"I am speaking literally,\" I am drawing\n\nlines, lines of writing, and life passes between the lines. A line of supple\n\nsegmentarity formed and became entangled with the other, but it was a\n\nvery different kind of line, shakily drawn by the micro-politics of the\n\nfar-seers. It is a political affair, as worldwide in scope as the other, but\non a\n\nscale and in a form that is incommensurable, nonsuperpos-able. It is also a\n\nperceptual affair, for perception always goes hand in hand with semiotics,\n\npractice, politics, theory.

They feel as though they foresee things\n\nand are ahead of the others because they see the smallest thing as already\n\nhaving happened; but they know that their warnings are to no avail because\n\nthe cutting telescope will set everything straight without being warned,\n\nwithout the need for or possibility of prediction. At times they feel that\n\nthey do indeed see something the others do not, but at other times that\n\nwhat they see differs only in degree and serves no purpose. Although they\n\nare collaborators with the most rigid and cruelest project of control, how\n\ncould they not feel a vague sympathy for the subterranean activity revealed\n\nto them?

We\n\nsaid that we are composed of lines, three kinds of lines. Or rather, of bun-\n\ndles of lines, for each kind is multiple. We may be more interested in a cer-\n\ntain line than in the others, and perhaps there is indeed one that is, not\n\ndetermining, but of greater importance . . . if it is there. For some of these\n\nlines are imposed on us from outside, at least in part. Others sprout up\n\nsomewhat by chance, from a trifle, why we will never know. Others can be\n\ninvented, drawn, without a model and without chance: we must invent our\n\nlines of flight, if we are able, and the only way we can invent them is by\n\neffectively drawing them, in our lives. Aren't lines of flight the most diffi-\n\ncult of all? Certain groups or people have none and never will. Certain\n\ngroups or people lack a given kind of line, or have lost it. The painter Flor-\n\nence Julien has a special interest in lines of flight: she invented a\nprocedure\n\nby which she extracts from photographs lines that are nearly abstract and\n\nformless. But once again, there is a bundle of very diverse lines: the line of\n\nflight of children leaving school at a run is different from that of demon-\n\nstrators chased by the police, or of a prisoner breaking out. There are\ndiffer-\n\nent animal lines of flight: each species, each individual, has its own.\n\nFernand Deligny transcribes the lines and paths of autistic children by\n\nmeans of _maps: _he carefully distinguishes \"lines of drift\" and \"customary\n\nlines.\" This does not only apply to walking; he also makes maps of percep-\n\ntions and maps of gestures (cooking or collecting wood) showing custom-\n\nary gestures and gestures of drift.

Deligny opened his lines of writing to life lines. The lines are con-\n\nstantly crossing, intersecting for a moment, following one another. A line of\n\ndrift intersects a customary line, and at that point the child does something\n\nnot quite belonging to either one: he or she finds something he or she lost\u2014\n\nwhat happened?\u2014or jumps and claps his or her hands, a slight and rapid\n\nmovement\u2014and that gesture in turn emits several lines.'\n\n2\n\nIn short, _there is _\n\n_a line of flight, which is already complex since it has singularities; and\nthere  \na customary or molar line with segments; and between the two (?), there is a  \nmolecular line with quanta that cause it to tip to one side or the other._\n\nAs Deligny says, it should be borne in mind that these lines mean noth-\n\ning. It is an affair of cartography. They compose us, as they compose our\n\nmap. They transform themselves and may even cross over into one\n\nanother. Rhizome. It is certain that they have nothing to do with language;\n\nit is, on the contrary, language that must follow them, it is writing that\nmust\n\ntake sustenance from them, _between _its own lines. It is certain that they\n\nhave nothing to do with a signifier, the determination of a subject by the\n\nsignifier; instead, the signifier arises at the most rigidified level of one\nof\n\nthe lines, and the subject is spawned at the lowest level. It is certain that\n\nthey have nothing to do with a structure, which is never occupied by any-\n\nthing more than points and positions, by arborescences, and which always\n\nforms a closed system, precisely in order to prevent escape. Deligny\n\ninvokes a common Body upon which these lines are inscribed as so many\n\nsegments, thresholds, or quanta, territorialities, deterritorializations, or\n\nreterritorializations. The lines are inscribed on a Body without Organs,\n\nupon which everything is drawn and flees, which is itself an abstract line\n\nwith neither imaginary figures nor symbolic functions: the real of the BwO.  \n_This body is the only practical object of schizoanalysis: _What is your body\n\nwithout organs? What are your lines? What map are you in the process of\n\nmaking or rearranging? What abstract line will you draw, and at what price,\n\nfor yourself and for others? What is your line of flight? What is your BwO,\n\nmerged with that line? Are you cracking up? Are you going to crack up? Are\n\nyou deterritorializing? Which lines are you severing, and which are you\n\nextending or resuming? Schizoanalysis does not pertain to elements or\n\naggregates, nor to subjects, relations, or structures. It pertains only to\n_linea-  \nments _running through groups as well as individuals. Schizoanalysis, as the\n\nanalysis of desire, is immediately practical and political, whether it is a\n\nquestion of an individual, group, or society. For politics precedes being.\n\nPractice does not come after the emplacement of the terms and their rela-\n\ntions, but actively participates in the drawing of the lines; it confronts the\n\nsame dangers and the same variations as the emplacement does.\n\nSchizoanalysis is like the art of the new.

The first concerns the  \n_particular character of each line. _It might be thought that rigid segments\n\nare socially determined, predetermined, overcoded by the State; there\n\nmay be a tendency to construe supple segmentarity as an interior activity,\n\nsomething imaginary or phantasmic. As for the line of flight, would it not\n\nbe entirely personal, the way in which an individual escapes on his or her\n\nown account, escapes \"responsibilities,\" escapes the world, takes refuge\n\nin the desert, or else in art... ? False impression. Supple segmentarity has\n\nnothing to do with the imaginary, and micropolitics is no less extensive\n\nor real than macropolitics. Politics on the grand scale can never\n\nadminister its molar segments without also dealing with the micro-\n\ninjections or infiltrations that work in its favor or present an obstacle to\nit;\n\nindeed, the larger the molar aggregates, the greater the molecularization\n\nof the agencies they put into play. Lines of flight, for their part, never\ncon-\n\nsist in running away from the world but rather in causing runoffs, as when\n\nyou drill a hole in a pipe; there is no social system that does not leak from\n\nall directions, even if it makes its segments increasingly rigid in order to\n\nseal the lines of flight. There is nothing imaginary, nothing symbolic,\n\nabout a line of flight. There is nothing more active than a line of flight,\n\namong animals or humans.\n\n13\n\nEven History is forced to take that route\n\nrather than proceeding by \"signifying breaks.\" What is escaping in a soci-\n\nety at a given moment? It is on lines of flight that new weapons are\n\ninvented, to be turned against the heavy arms of the State. \"I may be run-\n\nning, but I'm looking for a gun as I go\" (George Jackson). It was along lines\n\nof flight that the nomads swept away everything in their path and found\n\nnew weapons, leaving the Pharaoh thunderstruck. It is possible for a sin-\n\ngle group, or a single individual even, to exhibit all the lines we have been\n\ndiscussing simultaneously. But it is most frequently the case that a single\n\ngroup or individual functions as a line of flight; that group or individual\n\ncreates the line rather than following it, is itself the living weapon it\nforges\n\nrather than stealing one. Lines of flight are realities; they are very danger-\n\nous for societies, although they can get by without them, and sometimes\n\nmanage to keep them to a minimum.\n\nThe second problem concerns _the respective importance of the lines. _\n\nYou can begin with the rigid segmentarity, it's the easiest, it's pregiven;\n\nand then you can look at how and to what extent it is crosscut by a supple\n\nsegmentarity, a kind of rhizome surrounding its roots. Then you can look\n\nat how the line of flight enters in. And alliances and battles. But it is also\n\npossible to begin with the line of flight: perhaps this is the primary line,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)226.png)\n\n1874: THREE NOVELLAS, OR \"WHAT HAPPENED?\" \u25a1 205\n\nwith its absolute deterritorialization. It is clear that the line of flight\n_does  \nnot come afterward; _it is there from the beginning, even if it awaits its\n\nhour, and waits for the others to explode. Supple segmentarity, then, is\n\nonly a kind of compromise operating by relative deterritorializations and\n\npermitting reterritorializations that cause blockages and reversions to the\n\nrigid line. It is odd how supple segmentarity is caught between the two\n\nother lines, ready to tip to one side or the other; such is its ambiguity. It\nis\n\nalso necessary to look at the various combinations: it is quite possible that\n\none group or individual's line of flight may not work to benefit that of\n\nanother group or individual; it may on the contrary block it, plug it, throw\n\nit even deeper into rigid segmentarity. It can happen in love that one per-\n\nson's creative line is the other's imprisonment. The composition of the\n\nlines, of one line with another, is a problem, even of two lines of the same\n\ntype. There is no assurance that two lines of flight will prove compatible,\n\ncompossible. There is no assurance that the body without organs will be\n\neasy to compose. There is no assurance that a love, or a political ap-\n\nproach, will withstand it.\n\nThird problem: there is a _mutual immanence _of the lines. And it is not\n\neasy to sort them out. No one of them is transcendent, each is at work\n\nwithin the others. Immanence everywhere. Lines of flight are immanent to\n\nthe social field. Supple segmentarity continually dismantles the concre-\n\ntions of rigid segmentarity, but everything that it dismantles it reassembles\n\non its own level: micro-Oedipuses, microformations of power,\n\nmicrofascisms. The line of flight blasts the two segmentary series apart; but\n\nit is capable of the worst, of bouncing off the wall, falling into a black\nhole,\n\ntaking the path of greatest regression, and in its vagaries reconstructing the\n\nmost rigid of segments. Have you sown your wild oats? That is worse than\n\nnot escaping at all: See Lawrence's reproach to Melville.\n\n14\n\nBetween the\n\nmatter of a dirty little secret in rigid segmentarity, the empty form of\n\n\"What happened?\" in supple segmentarity, and clandestinity of what can\n\nno longer happen on the line of flight, how can we fail to see the upheavals\n\ncaused by a monster force, the Secret, threatening to bring everything tum-\n\nbling down? Between the Couple of the first kind of segmentarity, the Dou-\n\nble of the second, and the Clandestine of the line of flight, there are so\nmany\n\npossible mixtures and passages.\n\nThere is one last problem, the most anguishing one, concerning _the dan-_\n\n_gers specific to each line. _There is not much to say about the danger con-\n\nfronting the first, for the chances are slim that its rigidification will\nfail.\n\nThere is not much to say about the ambiguity of the second.

The human being\n\nis a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing\n\nus. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially\n\nsegmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms' assigned pur-\n\nposes; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to\nthe\n\nnature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a  \n_binary _fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social\nclasses,\n\nbut also men-women, adults-children, and so on. We are segmented in a _cir-_\n\n208\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)230.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY \u25a1 209\n\n_cular _fashion, in ever larger circles, ever wider disks or coronas, like\nJoyce's\n\n\"letter\": my affairs, my neighborhood's affairs, my city's, my country's, the\n\nworld's .. . We are segmented in a _linear _fashion, along a straight line or\na\n\nnumber of straight lines, of which each segment represents an episode or\n\n\"proceeding\": as soon as we finish one proceeding we begin another, forever\n\nproceduring or procedured, in the family, in school, in the army, on the job.\n\nSchool tells us, \"You're not at home anymore\"; the army tells us, \"You're not\n\nin school anymore\" . .. Sometimes the various segments belong to different\n\nindividuals or groups, and sometimes the same individual or group passes\n\nfrom one segment to another. But these figures of segmentarity, the binary,\n\ncircular, and linear, are bound up with one another, even cross over into each\n\nother, changing according to the point of view. This is already evident among\n\n\"savage\" peoples: Lizot shows how the communal House is organized in cir-\n\ncular fashion, going from interior to exterior in a series of coronas within\n\nwhich certain types of localizable activities take place (worship and ceremo-\n\nnies, followed by exchange of goods, followed by family life, followed by\n\ntrash and excrement); at the same time \"each of these coronas is itself\n\ntrans-versally divided, each segment devolves upon a particular lineage and is\n\nsubdivided among different kinship groups.\"\n\n1\n\nIn a more general context,\n\nLevi-Strauss shows that the dualist organization of primitive peoples has a\n\ncircular form, and also takes a linear form encompassing \"any number of\n\ngroups\" (at least three).\n\n2\n\nWhy return to the primitives, when it is a question of our own life? The\n\nfact is that the notion of segmentarity was constructed by ethnologists to\n\naccount for so-called primitive societies, which have no fixed, central State\n\napparatus and no global power mechanisms or specialized political institu-\n\ntions. In these societies, the social segments have a certain leeway, between\n\nthe two extreme poles of fusion and scission, depending on the task and the\n\nsituation; there is also considerable communicability between heterogene-\n\nous elements, so that one segment can fit with another in a number of\n\ndifferent ways; and they have a local construction excluding the prior\n\ndetermination of a base domain (economic, political, juridical, artistic);\n\nthey have extrinsic and situational properties, or relations irreducible to\n\nthe intrinsic properties of a structure; activity is continuous, so segmen-\n\ntarity is not grasped as something separate from a\n\nsegmentation-in-progress operating by outgrowths, detachments, and\n\nmergings. Primitive segmentarity is characterized by a polyvocal _code _\n\nbased on lineages and their varying situations and relations, and an\n\nitinerant _territoriality _based on local, overlapping divisions. Codes and\n\nterritories, clan lineages and tribal territorialities, form a fabric of\n\nrelatively supple segmentarity.\n\n3\n\nHowever, it seems to us difficult to maintain that State societies, even\n\nour modern States, are any less segmentary. The classical opposition\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)231.png)\n\n0\n\n210 \u25a1\n\n1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY\n\nbetween segmentarity and centralization hardly seems relevant.\n\n4\n\nNot only\n\ndoes the State exercise power over the segments it sustains or permits to\n\nsurvive, but it possesses, and imposes, its own segmentarity. Perhaps the\n\nopposition sociologists establish between the segmentary and the central is\n\nbiological deep down: the ringed worm, and the central nervous system.\n\nBut the central brain itself is a worm, even more segmented than the others,\n\nin spite of and including all of its vicarious actions. There is no opposition\n\nbetween the central and the segmentary. The modern political system is a\n\nglobal whole, unified and unifying, but is so because it implies a constella-\n\ntion of juxtaposed, imbricated, ordered subsystems; the analysis of deci-\n\nsion making brings to light all kinds of compartmentalizations and partial\n\nprocesses that interconnect, but not without gaps and displacements.\n\nTechnocracy operates by the segmentary division of labor (this applies to\n\nthe international division of labor as well). Bureaucracy exists only in com-\n\npartmentalized offices and functions only by \"goal displacements\" and the\n\ncorresponding \"dysfunctions.\" Hierarchy is not simply pyramidal; the\n\nboss's office is as much at the end of the hall as on top of the tower. In\nshort,\n\nwe would say that modern life has not done away with segmentarity but has\n\non the contrary made it exceptionally rigid.\n\nInstead of setting up an opposition between the segmentary and the cen-\n\ntralized, we should make a distinction between two types of segmentarity,\n\none \"primitive\" and supple, the other \"modern\" and rigid. This distinction\n\nreframes each of the figures previously discussed.\n\n1. Binary oppositions (men/women, those on top/those on the bottom,\n\netc.) are very strong in primitive societies, but seem to be the result of\n\nmachines and assemblages that are not in themselves binary. The social\n\nbinarity between men and women in a group applies rules according to\n\nwhich both sexes must take their respective spouses from different groups\n\n(which is why there are at least three groups). Thus Levi-Strauss can dem-\n\nonstrate that dualist organization never stands on its own in this kind of\n\nsociety. On the contrary, it is a particularity of modern societies, or rather\n\nState societies, to bring into their own duality machines that function as\n\nsuch, and proceed simultaneously by biunivocal relationships and succes-\n\nsively by binarized choices. Classes and sexes come in twos, and phenom-\n\nena of tripartition result from a transposition of the dual, not the reverse.\n\nWe have already encountered this, notably in the case of the Face machine,\n\nwhich differs in this respect from primitive head machines. It seems that\n\nmodern societies elevated dual segmentarity to the level of a self-sufficient\n\norganization. The question, therefore, is not whether the status of women,\n\nor those on the bottom, is better or worse, but the type of organization from\n\nwhich that status results.\n\n2. Similarly, we may note that in primitive societies circular segmen-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)232.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY D 211\n\ntarity does not necessarily imply that the circles are concentric, or have the\n\nsame center. In a supple regime, centers already act as so many _knots, eyes,\n_\n\nor _black holes; _but they do not all resonate together, they do not fall on\nthe\n\nsame point, they do not converge in the same black hole. There is a multi-\n\nplicity of animist eyes, each of which is assigned, for example, a particular\n\nanimal spirit (snake-spirit, woodpecker-spirit, cayman-spirit ...). Each\n\nblack hole is occupied by a different animal eye. Doubtless, we see opera-\n\ntions of rigidification and centralization take shape here and there: all of\n\nthe centers must collect on a single circle, which itself has a single center.\n\nThe shaman draws lines between all the points or spirits, outlines a constel-\n\nlation, a radiating set of roots tied to a central tree. This is the birth of\na cen-\n\ntralized power with an arborescent system to discipline the outgrowths of\n\nthe primitive rhizome.\n\n5\n\nHere, the tree simultaneously plays the role of a\n\nprinciple of dichotomy or binarity, and an axis of rotation. But the power of\n\nthe shaman is still entirely localized, strictly dependent upon a particular\n\nsegment, contingent upon drugs, and each point continues to emit inde-\n\npendent sequences. The same cannot be said of modern societies, or even\n\nof States. Of course, the centralized is not opposed to the segmentary, and\n\nthe circles remain distinct. But they become concentric, definitively\n\narborified. The segmentarity becomes rigid, to the extent that all centers\n\nresonate in, and all black holes fall on, a single point of accumulation that\nis\n\nlike a point of intersection somewhere behind the eyes. The face of the\n\nfather, teacher, colonel, boss, enter into redundancy, refer back to a center\n\nof signifiance that moves across the various circles and passes back over all\n\nof the segments. The supple microheads with animal facializations are\n\nreplaced by a macroface whose center is everywhere and circumference\n\nnowhere. There are no longer _n _eyes in the sky, or in becomings-animal and\n\n-vegetable, but a central computing eye scanning all of the radii. The cen-\n\ntral State is constituted not by the abolition of circular segmentarity but by\n\na concentricity of distinct circles, or the organization of a resonance among\n\ncenters. _There are already just as many power centers in primitive societies;  \nor, if one prefers, there are still just as many in State societies. _The\nlatter,\n\nhowever, behave as apparatuses of resonance; they organize resonance,\n\nwhereas the former inhibit it.\n\n6\n\n3\\. Finally, in the case of linear segmentarity, we would say that each seg-\n\nment is underscored, rectified, and homogenized in its own right, but also\n\nin relation to the others. Not only does each have its own unit of measure,\n\nbut there is an equivalence and translatability between units. The central\n\neye has as its correlate a space through which it moves, but it itself remains\n\ninvariant in relation to its movements. With the Greek city-state and\n\nCleisthenes' reform, a homogeneous and isotopic space appears that\n\novercodes the lineal segments, at the same time as distinct focal points\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)233.png)\n\n0\n\n212 \u25a1\n\n1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY\n\nbegin to resonate in a center acting as their common denominator.\n\n7\n\nPaul\n\nVirilio shows that after the Greek city-state, the Roman Empire imposes a\n\ngeometrical or _linear reason of State _including a general outline of camps\n\nand fortifications, a universal art of \"marking boundaries by lines,\" a\n\nlaying-out of territories, a substitution of space for places and\nterritoriali-\n\nties, and a transformation of the world into the city; in short, an increas-\n\ningly rigid segmentarity.\n\n8\n\nThe segments, once underscored or overcoded,\n\nseem to lose their ability to bud, they seem to lose their dynamic relation to\n\nsegmentations-in-progress, or in the act of coming together or coming\n\napart. If there exists a primitive \"geometry\" (a protogeometry), it is an\n\noperative geometry in which figures are never separable from the affecta-\n\ntions befalling them, the lines of their becoming, the segments of their seg-\n\nmentation: there is \"roundness,\" but no circle, \"alignments,\" but no\n\nstraight line, etc. On the contrary, State geometry, or rather the bond\n\nbetween the State and geometry, manifests itself in the primacy of the\n\ntheorem-element, which substitutes fixed or ideal essences for supple mor-\n\nphological formations, properties for affects, predetermined segments for\n\nsegmentations-in-progress. Geometry and arithmetic take on the power of\n\nthe scalpel. Private property implies a space that has been overcoded and\n\ngridded by surveying. Not only does each line have its segments, but the\n\nsegments of one line correspond to those of another; for example, the wage\n\nregime establishes a correspondence between monetary segments, produc-\n\ntion segments, and consumable-goods segments.\n\nWe may summarize the principal differences between rigid segmentarity\n\nand supple segmentarity. In the rigid mode, binary segmentarity stands on\n\nits own and is governed by great machines of direct binarization, whereas in\n\nthe other mode, binarities result from \"multiplicities of _n _dimensions.\"\nSec-\n\nond, circular segmentarity tends to become concentric, in other words,\n\ncauses all of its focal points to coincide in a single center that is in\nconstant\n\nmovement but remains invariant through its movements, and is part of a\n\nmachine of resonance. Finally, linear segmentarity feeds into a machine of\n\novercoding that constitutes _more geometrico _homogeneous space and\n\nextracts segments that are determinate as to their substance, form, and rela-\n\ntions. It will be noted that this rigid segmentarity is always expressed by\nthe\n\nTree. The Tree is the knot of arborescence or principle of dichotomy; it is\nthe\n\naxis of'rotation guaranteeing concentricity; it is the structure or network\n\ngridding the possible. This opposition between arborified and rhizomatic\n\nsegmentarity is not just meant to indicate two states of a single process, but\n\nalso to isolate two different processes. For primitive societies operate\nessen-\n\ntially by codes and territorialities. It is in fact the distinction between\nthese\n\ntwo elements, the tribal system of territories and the clan system of\nlineages,\n\nthat prevents resonance.\n\n9\n\nModern, or State, societies, on the other hand,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)234.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY \u25a1 213\n\nhave replaced the declining codes with a univocal overcoding, and the lost\n\nterritories with a specific reterritorialization (which takes place in an\n\novercoded geometrical space). Segmentarity is always the result of an\n\nabstract machine, but different abstract machines operate in the rigid and\n\nthe supple.\n\nIt is not enough, therefore, to oppose the centralized to the segmentary.\n\nNor is it enough to oppose two kinds of segmentarity, one supple and prim-\n\nitive, the other modern and rigidified. There is indeed a distinction\n\nbetween the two, but they are inseparable, they overlap, they are entangled.\n\nPrimitive societies have nuclei of rigidity or arborification that as much\n\nanticipate the State as ward it off. Conversely, our societies are still suf-\n\nfused by a supple fabric without which their rigid segments would not hold.\n\nSupple segmentarity cannot be restricted to primitive peoples. It is not the\n\nvestige of the savage within us but a perfectly contemporary function,\n\ninseparable from the other. Every society, and every individual, are thus\n\nplied by both segmentarities simultaneously: one molar, the other _molecu-  \nlar. _If they are distinct, it is because they do not have the same terms or\nthe\n\nsame relations or the same nature or even the same type of multiplicity. If\n\nthey are inseparable, it is because they coexist and cross over into each\n\nother. The configurations differ, for example, between the primitives and\n\nus, but the two segmentarities are always in presupposition. In short, every-\n\nthing is political, but every politics is simultaneously a _macropolitics _and\na  \n_micropolitics. _Take aggregates of the perception or feeling type: their\nmolar\n\norganization, their rigid segmentarity, does not preclude the existence of\n\nan entire world of unconscious micropercepts, unconscious affects, fine\n\nsegmentations that grasp or experience different things, are distributed\n\nand operate differently. There is a micropolitics of perception, affection,\n\nconversation, and so forth. If we consider the great binary aggregates, such\n\nas the sexes or classes, it is evident that they also cross over into\nmolecular\n\nassemblages of a different nature, and that there is a double reciprocal\n\ndependency between them. For the two sexes imply a multiplicity of molec-\n\nular combinations bringing into play not only the man in the woman and\n\nthe woman in the man, but the relation of each to the animal, the plant, etc.:\n\na thousand tiny sexes. And social classes themselves imply \"masses\" that\n\ndo not have the same kind of movement, distribution, or objectives and do\n\nnot wage the same kind of struggle. Attempts to distinguish mass from class\n\neffectively tend toward this limit: _the notion of mass is a molecular notion\n_\n\noperating according to a type of segmentation irreducible to the molar\n\nsegmentarity of class.

For at the same time there is a whole bureaucratic segmen-\n\ntation, a suppleness of and communication between offices, a bureaucratic\n\nperversion, a permanent inventiveness or creativity practiced even against\n\nadministrative regulations. If Kafka is the greatest theorist of bureaucracy,\n\nit is because he shows how, at a certain level (but which one? it is not\n\nlocalizable), the barriers between offices cease to be \"a definite dividing\n\nline\" and are immersed in a molecular medium _(milieu) _that dissolves\n\nthem and simultaneously makes the office manager proliferate into\n\nmicrofigures impossible to recognize or identify, discernible only when\n\nthey are centralizable: another regime, coexistent with the separation _and _\n\ntotalization of the rigid segments.\n\nI0\n\nWe would even say that fascism implies\n\na molecular regime that is distinct both from molar segments and their cen-\n\ntralization. Doubtless, fascism invented the concept of the totalitarian\n\nState, but there is no reason to define fascism by a concept of its own devis-\n\ning: there are totalitarian States, of the Stalinist or military dictatorship\n\ntype, that are not fascist. The concept of the totalitarian State applies only\n\nat the macropohtical level, to a rigid segmentarity and a particular mode of\n\ntotalization and centralization. But fascism is inseparable from a prolifera-\n\ntion of molecular focuses in interaction, which skip from point to point,  \n_before _beginning to resonate together in the National Socialist State. Rural\n\nfascism and city or neighborhood fascism, youth fascism and war veteran's\n\nfascism, fascism of the Left and fascism of the Right, fascism of the couple,\n\nfamily, school, and office: every fascism is defined by a micro-black hole\n\nthat stands on its own and communicates with the others, before resonat-\n\ning in a great, generalized central black hole.\n\n1\n\n' There is fascism when a _war _\n\n_machine _is installed in each hole, in every niche. Even after the National\n\nSocialist State had been established, microfascisms persisted that gave it\n\nunequaled ability to act upon the \"masses.\" Daniel Guerin is correct to say\n\nthat if Hitler took power, rather then taking over the German State admin-\n\nistration, it was because from the beginning he had at his disposal\n\nmicroorganizations giving him \"an unequaled, irreplaceable ability to\n\npenetrate every cell of society,\" in other words, a molecular and supple\n\nsegmentarity, flows capable of suffusing every kind of cell.

What makes fascism dangerous is its molecular or micropolitical\n\npower, for it is a mass movement: a cancerous body rather than a totalitar-\n\nian organism. American film has often depicted these molecular focal\n\npoints; band, gang, sect, family, town, neighborhood, vehicle fascisms\n\nspare no one. Only microfascism provides an answer to the global ques-\n\ntion: Why does desire desire its own repression, how can it desire its own\n\nrepression? The masses certainly do not passively submit to power; nor do\n\nthey \"want\" to be repressed, in a kind of masochistic hysteria; nor are they\n\ntricked by an ideological lure. Desire is never separable from complex\n\nassemblages that necessarily tie into molecular levels, from\n\nmicroforma-tions already shaping postures, attitudes, perceptions,\n\nexpectations, semiotic systems, etc. Desire is never an undifferentiated\n\ninstinctual energy, but itself results from a highly developed, engineered\n\nsetup rich in interactions: a whole supple segmentarity that processes\n\nmolecular energies and potentially gives desire a fascist determination.\n\nLeftist organizations will not be the last to secrete microfascisms. It's too\n\neasy to be antifascist on the molar level, and not even see the fascist\n\ninside you, the fascist you yourself sustain and nourish and cherish with\n\nmolecules both personal and collective.\n\nFour errors concerning this molecular and supple segmentarity are to be\n\navoided. The first is axiological and consists in believing that a little sup-\n\npleness is enough to make things \"better.\" But microfascisms are what\n\nmake fascism so dangerous, and fine segmentations are as harmful as the\n\nmost rigid of segments. The second is psychological, as if the molecular\n\nwere in the realm of the imagination and applied only to the individual and\n\ninterindividual. But there is just as much social-Real on one line as on the\n\nother. Third, the two forms are not simply distinguished by size, as a small\n\nform and a large form; although it is true that the molecular works in detail\n\nand operates in small groups, this does not mean that it is any less coexten-\n\nsive with the entire social field than molar organization. Finally, the quali-\n\ntative difference between the two lines does not preclude their boosting or\n\ncutting into each other; there is always a proportional relation between the\n\ntwo, directly or inversely proportional.\n\nIn the first case, the stronger the molar organization is, the more it\n\ninduces a molecularization of its own elements, relations, and elementary\n\napparatuses. When the machine becomes planetary or cosmic, there is an\n\nincreasing tendency for assemblages to miniaturize, to become\n\nmicro-assemblages. Following Andre Gorz's formula, the only remaining\n\nelement of work left under world capitalism is the molecular, or\n\nmolecularized, individual, in other words, the \"mass\" individual.

That is\n\nwhat French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing was saying in his military\n\nand political geography lesson: the more balanced things are between East\n\nand West, in an overcoding and overarmed dualist machine, the more\n\n\"destabilized\" they become along the other, North-South, line. There is\n\nalways a Palestinian or Basque or Corsican to bring about a \"regional\n\ndestabilization of security.\"\n\n13\n\nThe two great molar aggregates of the East\n\nand West are perpetually being undermined by a molecular segmentation\n\ncausing a zigzag crack, making it difficult for them to keep their own seg-\n\nments in line. It is as if a line of flight, perhaps only a tiny trickle to\nbegin\n\nwith, leaked between the segments, escaping their centralization, eluding\n\ntheir totalization. The profound movements stirring in a society present\n\nthemselves in this fashion, even if they are necessarily \"represented\" as a\n\nconfrontation between molar segments. It is wrongly said (in Marxism in\n\nparticular) that a society is defined by its contradictions. That is true only\n\non the larger scale of things. From the viewpoint of micropolitics, a society\n\nis defined by its lines of flight, which are molecular. There is always some-\n\nthing that flows or flees, that escapes the binary organizations, the reso-\n\nnance apparatus, and the overcoding machine: things that are attributed to\n\na \"change in values,\" the youth, women, the mad, etc. May 1968 in France\n\nwas molecular, making what led up to it all the more imperceptible from\n\nthe viewpoint of macropolitics. It happens that people who are very lim-\n\nited in outlook or are very old grasp the event better than the most\n\nadvanced politicians, or politicians who consider themselves advanced\n\nfrom the viewpoint of organization. As Gabriel Tarde said, what one needs\n\nto know is which peasants, in which areas of the south of France, stopped\n\ngreeting the local landowners. A very old, outdated landowner can in this\n\ncase judge things better than a modernist. It was the same with May '68:\n\nthose who evaluated things in macropohtical terms understood nothing of\n\nthe event because something unaccountable was escaping. The politicians,\n\nthe parties, the unions, many leftists, were utterly vexed; they kept repeat-\n\ning over and over again that \"conditions\" were not ripe. It was as though\n\nthey had been temporarily deprived of the entire dualism machine that\n\nmade them valid spokespeople. Bizarrely, de Gaulle, and even Pompidou,\n\nunderstood much more than the others. A molecular flow was escaping,\n\nminuscule at first, then swelling, without, however, ceasing to be\n\nunassignable. The reverse, however, is also true: molecular escapes and\n\nmovements would be nothing if they did not return to the molar orga-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)238.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY \u25a1 217\n\nnizations to reshuffle their segments, their binary distributions of sexes,\n\nclasses, and parties.\n\nThe issue is that the molar and the molecular are distinguished not by\n\nsize, scale, or dimension but by the nature of the system of reference envi-\n\nsioned. Perhaps, then, the words \"line\" and \"segment\" should be reserved\n\nfor molar organization, and other, more suitable, words should be sought\n\nfor molecular composition. And in fact, whenever we can identify a\n\nwell-defined _segmented line, _we notice that it continues in another form,\n\nas a _quantum flow. _And in every instance, we can locate a \"power center\" at\n\nthe border between the two, defined not by an absolute exercise of power\n\nwithin its domain but by the relative adaptations and conversions it effects\n\nbetween the line and the flow. Take a monetary flow with segments. These\n\nsegments can be defined from several points of view, for example, from the\n\nviewpoint of a corporate budget (real wages, net profit, management sala-\n\nries, interest on assets, reserves, investments, etc.). Now this line of\n\npayment-money is linked to another aspect, namely, the flow of\n\nfinancing-money, which has, not segments, but rather poles, singularities,\n\nand quanta (the poles of the flow are the creation of money and its\n\ndestruction; the singularities are nominal liquid assets; the quanta are\n\ninflation, deflation, stagflation, etc.). This has led some to speak of a\n\n\"mutant, convulsive, creative and circulatory flow\" tied to desire and\n\nalways subjacent to the solid line and its segments determining interest\n\nrates and supply and demand.\n\n14\n\nIn a balance of payment, we again\n\nencounter a binary segmentarity that distinguishes, for example,\n\nso-called autonomous operations from so-called compensatory operations.\n\nBut movements of capital do not allow themselves to be segmented in this\n\nway; because they are _\"the most thoroughly broken down, _according to\n\ntheir nature, duration, and the personality of the creditor or debtor,\" one\n\"no\n\nlonger has any idea where to draw the line when dealing with these\n\nflows.\"\n\n15\n\nYet there is always a correlation between the two aspects since\n\nlinearization and segmentation are where flows run dry, but are also their\n\npoint of departure for a new creation. When we talk about banking power,\n\nconcentrated most notably in the central banks, it is indeed a question of\n\nthe relative power to regulate \"as much as\" possible the communication,\n\nconversion, and coadaptation of the two parts of the circuit. That is why\n\npower centers are defined much more by what escapes them or by their\n\nimpotence than by their zone of power. In short, the molecular, or\n\nmicroeconomics, micropolitics, is defined not by the smallness of its\n\nelements but by the nature of its \"mass\"\u2014the quantum flow as opposed to\n\nthe molar segmented line.\n\n16\n\nThe task of making the segments correspond to\n\nthe quanta, of adjusting the segments to the quanta, implies hit-and-miss\n\nchanges in rhythm and mode rather than any omnipotence; and something\n\nalways escapes.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)239.png)\n\n0\n\n218 \u25a1\n\n1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY\n\nWe could take other examples, such as the power of the Church. Church\n\npower has always been associated with a certain administration of sin\n\npossessing a strong segmentarity (the seven deadly sins), units of measure\n\n(how many times?), and rules of equivalence and atonement (confession,\n\npenance . . .). But there is also what might be called the molecular flow of\n\nsinfulness, something quite different yet complementary: it hugs close to\n\nthe linear zone, as though negotiated through it, but itself has only poles\n\n(original sin-redemption or grace) and quanta (\"that sin which is the\n\ndefault of consciousness of sin\"; the sin of having a consciousness of sin;\n\nthe sin of the consequence of having a consciousness of sin).\n\n17\n\nThe same\n\ncould be said of a flow of criminality, in contrast to the molar line of a\nlegal\n\ncode and its divisions. Or to take another example, discussions of military\n\npower, or the power of the army, consider a segmentable line broken down\n\ninto types of war corresponding exactly to the States waging war and the\n\npolitical goals those States assign themselves (from \"limited\" war to \"total\"\n\nwar). But following Clausewitz's intuition, the war machine is very differ-\n\nent; it is a flow of _absolute _war stretching between an offensive and a\ndefen-\n\nsive pole, and is marked only by quanta (psychic and material forces that\n\nare like the nominal liquid assets of war). We may say of the pure flow that\nit\n\nis abstract yet real; ideal yet effective; absolute yet \"differentiated.\" It\nis\n\ntrue that the flow and its quanta can be grasped only by virtue of indexes on\n\nthe segmented line, but conversely, that line and those indexes exist only by\n\nvirtue of the flow suffusing them.

Durkheim's preferred objects of study were the great\n\ncollective representations, which are generally binary, resonant, and\n\novercoded. Tarde countered that collective representations presuppose\n\nexactly what needs explaining, namely, \"the similarity of millions of\n\npeople.\" That is why Tarde was interested instead in the world of detail,\n\nor of the infini-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)240.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY D 219\n\ntesimal: the little _imitations, oppositions, _and _inventions _constituting\nan\n\nentire realm of subrepresentative matter. Tarde's best work was his analy-\n\nses of a minuscule bureaucratic innovation, or a linguistic innovation, etc.\n\nThe Durkheimians answered that what Tarde did was psychology or\n\ninter-psychology, not sociology. But that is true only in appearance, as a\n\nfirst approximation: a microimitation does seem to occur between two\n\nindividuals. But at the same time, and at a deeper level, it has to do not\n\nwith an individual but with a flow or a wave. _Imitation is the propagation of  \na flow; opposition is binarization, the making binary of flows; invention is a  \nconjugation or connection of different flows. _What, according to Tarde, is a\n\nflow? It is belief or desire (the two aspects of every assemblage); a flow is\n\nalways of belief and of desire. Beliefs and desires are the basis of every\n\nsociety, because they are flows and as such are \"quantifiable\"; they are\n\nveritable social Quantities, whereas sensations are qualitative and\n\nrepresentations are simple resultants.\n\n18\n\nInfinitesimal imitation, opposition,\n\nand invention are therefore like flow quanta marking a propagation,\n\nbinarization, or conjugation of beliefs and desires. Hence the importance\n\nof statistics, providing it concerns itself with the cutting edges and not\n\nonly with the \"stationary\" zone of representations. For in the end, the\n\ndifference is not at all between the social and the individual (or\n\ninterindividual), but between the molar realm of representations, individual\n\nor collective, and the molecular realm of beliefs and desires in which the\n\ndistinction between the social and the individual loses all meaning since\n\nflows are neither attributable to individuals nor overcodable by collective\n\nsignifiers. Representations already define large-scale aggregates, or\n\ndetermine segments on a line; beliefs and desires, on the other hand, are\n\nflows marked by quanta, flows that are created, exhausted, or\n\ntransformed, added to one another, subtracted or combined.

A mutant flow always implies something tending to elude or\n\nescape the codes; quanta are precisely signs or degrees of\n\ndeterrito-rialization in the decoded flow. The rigid line, on the other\n\nhand, implies an overcoding that substitutes itself for the faltering codes;\nits\n\nsegments are like reterritorializations on the overcoding or overcoded line.\n\nLet us return to the case of original sin: it is the very act of a flow\nmarking\n\na decoding in relation to creation (with just one last island preserved for\n\nthe Virgin), and a deterritorialization in relation to the land of Adam; but\nit\n\nsimultaneously performs an overcoding by binary organizations and\n\nresonance (Powers, Church, empires, rich-poor, men-women, etc.) and\n\ncomplementary reterritorializations (on the land of Cain, on work, on\n\nreproduction, on\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)241.png)\n\n0\n\n220 \u25a1\n\n1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY\n\nmoney.. .)\u2022 Now the two systems of reference are in inverse relation to\n\neach other, in the sense that the first eludes the second, or the second\narrests\n\nthe first, prevents it from flowing further; but at the same time, they are\n\nstrictly complementary and coexistent, because one exists only as a func-\n\ntion of the other; yet they are different and in direct relation to each\n\nother, although corresponding term by term, because the second only\n\neffectively arrests the first on a \"plane\" that is not the plane specific to\nthe\n\nfirst, while the momentum of the first continues on its own plane.\n\nA social field is always animated by all kinds of movements of decoding\n\nand deterritorialization affecting \"masses\" and operating at different\n\nspeeds and paces. These are not contradictions but escapes. At this level,\n\neverything is a question of _mass. _For example, from the tenth to the four-\n\nteenth centuries we see an acceleration of factors of decoding and deterri-\n\ntorialization: the masses of the last invaders swooping down from north,\n\neast, and south; military masses turned into pillaging bands; ecclesiastical\n\nmasses confronted with infidels and heretics, and adopting increasingly\n\ndeterritorialized objectives; peasant masses leaving the seigneurial do-\n\nmains; seigneurial masses forced to find means of exploitation less terri-\n\ntorial than serfdom; urban masses breaking away from the backcountry\n\nand finding increasingly less territorialized social arrangements in the cit-\n\nies; women's masses detaching themselves from the old passional and con-\n\njugal code; monetary masses that cease to be a hoard object and inject\n\nthemselves into great commercial circuits.\n\n19\n\nWe may cite the Crusades as\n\neffecting a connection of flows, each boosting and accelerating the others\n\n(even the flow of femininity in the \"faraway Princess,\" even the flow of chil-\n\ndren in the Crusades of the thirteenth century). But at the same time, and\n\ninseparably, there occur overcodings and reterritorializations. The Cru-\n\nsades were overcoded by the pope and assigned territorial objectives. The\n\nHoly Land, the Peace of God, a new type of abbey, new figures of money,\n\nnew modes of exploitation of the peasant through leasehold and the wage\n\nsystem (or revivals of slavery), urban reterritorializations, etc., form a\n\ncomplex system. At this point, we must introduce a distinction between the\n\ntwo notions of _connection _and _conjugation _of flows. \"Connection\" indi-\n\ncates the way in which decoded and deterritorialized flows boost one\n\nanother, accelerate their shared escape, and augment or stoke their quanta;\n\nthe \"conjugation\" of these same flows, on the other hand, indicates their\n\nrelative stoppage, like a point of accumulation that plugs or seals the lines\n\nof flight, performs a general reterritorialization, and brings the flows under\n\nthe dominance of a single flow capable of overcoding them. But it is pre-\n\ncisely the most deterritorialized flow, under the first aspect, that always\n\nbrings about the accumulation or conjunction of the processes, determines\n\nthe overcoding, and serves as the basis for reterritorialization under the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)242.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY D 221\n\nsecond aspect (we have already encountered a theorem according to which\n\nit is always _on _the most deterritorialized element that reterritorialization\n\ntakes place). For example, the merchant bourgeoisie of the cities conju-\n\ngated or capitalized a domain of knowledge, a technology, assemblages and\n\ncircuits into whose dependency the nobility, Church, artisans, and even\n\npeasants _would enter. _It is precisely because the bourgeoisie was a cutting\n\nedge of deterritorialization, a veritable particle accelerator, that it also\nper-\n\nformed an overall reterritorialization.\n\nThe task of the historian is to designate the \"period\" of coexistence or\n\nsimultaneity of these two movements (decoding-deterritorialization and\n\novercoding-reterritorialization). For the duration of this period, one distin-\n\nguishes between the molecular aspect and the molar aspect: on the one hand,  \n_masses or flows, _with their mutations, quanta of deterritorialization, con-\n\nnections, and accelerations; on the other hand, _classes or segments, _with\n\ntheir binary organization, resonance, conjunction or accumulation, and line\n\nof overcoding favoring one line over the others.\n\n20\n\nThe difference between\n\nmacrohistory and microhistory has nothing to do with the length of the\n\ndurations envisioned, long or short, but rather concerns distinct systems of\n\nreference, depending on whether it is an overcoded segmented line that is\n\nunder consideration or the mutant quantum flow. The rigid system does not\n\nbring the other system to a halt: the flow continues beneath the line, forever\n\nmutant, while the line totalizes. _Mass _and _class _do not have the same con-\n\ntours or the same dynamic, even though the same group can be assigned both\n\nsigns. The bourgeoisie considered as a mass _and as _a class... The relations\n\nof a mass to other masses are not the same as the relations of the \"corre-\n\nsponding\" class to the other classes. Of course, there are just as many rela-\n\ntions of force, and just as much violence, on one side as the other. The point\n\nis that the same struggle assumes two very different aspects, in relation to\n\nwhich the victories and defeats differ. Mass movements accelerate and feed\n\ninto one another (or dim for a long while, enter long stupors), but jump from\n\none class to another, undergo mutation, emanate or emit new quanta that\n\nthen modify class relations, bring their overcoding and reterritorialization\n\ninto question, and run new lines of flight in new directions. Beneath the\n\nself-reproduction of classes, there is always a variable map of masses.\n\nPolitics operates by macrodecisions and binary choices, binarized interests;\n\nbut the realm of the decidable remains very slim. Political decision making\n\nnecessarily descends into a world of microdeterminations, attractions,\n\nand desires, which it must sound out or evaluate in a different fashion.\n\nBeneath linear conceptions and segmentary decisions, an evaluation of\n\nflows and their quanta.

Good or bad, pol-\n\nitics and its judgments are always molar, but it is the molecular and its\nassess-\n\nment that makes it or breaks it.\n\nNow we are in a better position to draw a map. If we return to a very gen-\n\neral sense of the word \"line,\" we see that there are not just two kinds of\nlines\n\nbut three. First, a relatively supple line of interlaced codes and\nterritoriali-\n\nties; that is why we started with so-called _primitive _segmentarity, in which\n\nthe social space is constituted by territorial and lineal segmentations. Sec-\n\nond, a rigid line, which brings about a dualist organization of segments, a\n\nconcentricity of circles in resonance, and generalized overcoding; here, the\n\nsocial space implies a _State apparatus. _This system is different from the\n\nprimitive system precisely because overcoding is not a stronger code, but a\n\nspecific procedure different from that of codes (similarly,\n\nreterrito-rialization is not an added territory, but takes place in a\ndifferent\n\nspace than that of territories, namely, overcoded geometrical space).\n\nThird, one or several lines of flight, marked by quanta and defined by\n\ndecoding and deterritorialization (there is always something like a _war  \nmachine _functioning on these lines).\n\nThis way of presenting things still has the disadvantage of making it\n\nseem as though primitive societies came first. In truth, codes are never sep-\n\narable from the movement of decoding, nor are territories from the vectors\n\nof deterritorialization traversing them. And overcoding and\n\nreterrito-rialization do not come after. It would be more accurate to say that\n\nthere is a space in which the three kinds of closely intermingled lines\n\ncoexist, tribes, empires, and war machines. We could also put it this way:\n\nlines of flight are primary, _or _the already-rigid segments are, and supple\n\nsegmentations swing between the two. Take a proposition like the following\n\none by the historian Pirenne about barbarian tribes: \"The Barbarians did\n\nnot spontaneously hurl themselves upon the Empire. They were pushed\n\nforward by the flood of the Hunnish advance, which in this way caused the\n\nwhole series of invasions.\"\n\n22\n\nOn one side, we have the rigid segmentarity\n\nof the Roman Empire, with its center of resonance and periphery, its\n\nState, its _pax romana, _its geometry, its camps, its _limes _(boundary\nlines).\n\nThen, on the horizon, there is an entirely different kind of line, the line of\n\nthe nomads who come in off the steppes, venture a fluid and active escape,\n\nsow deterritorialization everywhere, launch flows whose quanta heat up and\n\nare swept along by a Stateless war machine. The migrant barbarians are\n\nindeed between the two: they come and go, cross and recross frontiers,\n\npillage and ransom, but also integrate themselves and reterritorialize. At\n\ntimes they\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)244.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY D 223\n\nwill subside into the empire, assigning themselves a segment of it, becom-\n\ning mercenaries or confederates, settling down, occupying land or carving\n\nout their own State (the wise Visigoths). At other times, they will go over to\n\nthe nomads, allying with them, becoming indiscernible (the brilliant\n\nOstrogoths). Perhaps because they were constantly being defeated by the\n\nHuns and Visigoths, the Vandals (\"zone-two Goths\") drew a line of flight\n\nthat made them as strong as their masters; they were the only band or mass\n\nto cross the Mediterranean. But they were also the ones who produced the\n\nmost startling reterritorialization: an empire in Africa.\n\n23\n\nThus it seems that\n\nthe three lines do not only coexist, but transform themselves into one\n\nanother, cross over into one another. Again, we have taken a summary\n\nexample in which the lines are illustrated by different groups. What we\n\nhave said applies all the more to cases in which all of the lines are in a\nsingle\n\ngroup, a single individual.\n\nIn view of this, it would be better to talk about simultaneous states of the\n\nabstract Machine. There is on the one hand an _abstract machine of  \novercoding: _it defines a rigid segmentarity, a macrosegmentarity, because it\n\nproduces or rather reproduces segments, opposing them two by two, mak-\n\ning all the centers resonate, and laying out a divisible, homogeneous space\n\nstriated in all directions. This kind of abstract machine is linked to the\n\nState apparatus. We do not, however, equate it with the State apparatus\n\nitself. The abstract machine may be defined, for example, _more  \ngeomet-rico, _or under other conditions by an \"axiomatic\"; but the State\n\napparatus is neither geometry nor axiomatics: it is only the assemblage of\n\nreterritorialization effectuating the overcoding machine within given limits\n\nand under given conditions. The most we can say is that the State apparatus\n\ntends increasingly to identify with the abstract machine it effectuates.\n\nThis is where the notion of the totalitarian State becomes meaningful: a\n\nState becomes totalitarian when, instead of effectuating, within its own\n\nlimits, the worldwide overcoding machine, it identifies with it, creating the\n\nconditions for \"autarky,\" producing a reterritorialization by \"closed ves-\n\nsel,\" in the artifice of the void (this is never an ideological operation, but\n\nrather an economic and political one).\n\n24\n\nOn the other hand, at the other pole, there is an abstract machine of\n\nmutation, which operates by decoding and deterritorialization. It is what\n\ndraws the lines of flight: it steers the quantum flows, assures the connec-\n\ntion-creation of flows, and emits new quanta. It itself is in a state of\nflight,\n\nand erects war machines on its lines. If it constitutes another pole, it is\n\nbecause molar or rigid segments always seal, plug, block the lines of flight,\n\nwhereas this machine is always making them flow, \"between\" the rigid seg-\n\nments and in another, submolecular, direction. But between the two poles\n\nthere is also a whole realm of properly molecular negotiation, translation,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)245.png)\n\n0\n\n224 D\n\n1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY\n\nand transduction in which at times molar lines are already undermined by\n\nfissures and cracks, and at other times lines of flight are already drawn\n\ntoward black holes, flow connections are already replaced by limitative\n\nconjunctions, and quanta emissions are already converted into\n\ncenter-points. All of this happens at the same time. It is at the same time\n\nthat lines of flight connect and continue their intensities, whip\n\nparticles-signs out of black holes; and also retreat into the swirl of\n\nmicro-black holes or molecular conjunctions that interrupt them; or\n\nagain, enter overcoded, concentricized, binarized, stable segments\n\narrayed around a central black hole.\n\n_What is a center or focal point of power? _Answering this question will\n\nillustrate the entanglement of the lines. We speak of the power of the army,\n\nChurch, and school, of public and private power ... Power centers obvi-\n\nously involve rigid segments. Each molar segment has one or more centers.\n\nIt might be objected that the segments themselves presuppose a power cen-\n\nter, as what distinguishes and unites them, sets them in opposition and\n\nmakes them resonate. But there is no contradiction between the segmen-\n\ntary parts and the centralized apparatus. On the one hand, the most rigid of\n\nsegmentarities does not preclude centralization: this is because the com-\n\nmon central point is not where all the other points melt together, but\n\ninstead acts as a point of resonance on the horizon, behind all the other\n\npoints. The State is not a point taking all the others upon itself, but a\nreso-\n\nnance chamber for them all. Even when the State is totalitarian, its func-\n\ntion as resonator for distinct centers and segments remains unchanged: the\n\nonly difference is that it takes place under closed-vessel conditions that\n\nincrease its internal reach, or couples \"resonance\" with a \"forced move-\n\nment.\" On the other hand, and conversely, the strictest of centralizations\n\ndoes not eradicate the distinctiveness of the centers, segments, and circles.\n\nWhen the overcoding line is drawn, it assures the prevalence of one seg-\n\nment, as such, over the other (in the case of binary segmentarity), gives a\n\ncertain center a power of relative resonance over the others (in the case of\n\ncircular segmentarity), and underscores the dominant segment through\n\nwhich it itself passes (in the case of linear segmentarity). Thus centraliza-\n\ntion is always hierarchical, but hierarchy is always segmentary.\n\nEach power center is also molecular and exercises its power on a\n\nmicrological fabric in which it exists only as diffuse, dispersed, geared\n\ndown, miniaturized, perpetually displaced, acting by fine segmentation,\n\nworking in detail and in the details of detail. Foucault's analysis of \"disci-\n\nplines\" or micropowers (school, army, factory, hospital, etc.) testifies to\n\nthese \"focuses of instability\" where groupings and accumulations confront\n\neach other, but also confront breakaways and escapes, and where inver-\n\nsions occur.\n\n25\n\nWhat we have is no longer The Schoolmaster but the monitor,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)246.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY \u25a1 225\n\nthe best student, the class dunce, the janitor, etc. No longer the general,\nbut\n\nthe junior officers, the noncommissioned officers, the soldier inside me,\n\nand also the malcontent: all have their own tendencies, poles, conflicts, and\n\nrelations of force. Even the warrant officer and janitor are only invoked for\n\nexplanatory purposes; for they have a molar side _and _a molecular side, and\n\nmake us realize that the general or the landlord also had both sides all\n\nalong. We would not say that the proper name loses its power when it enters\n\nthese zones of indiscernibility, but that it takes on a new kind of power. To\n\ntalk like Kafka, what we have is no longer the public official Klamm, but\n\nmaybe his secretary Momus, or other molecular Klamms the differences\n\nbetween which, and with Klamm, are all the greater for no longer being\n\nassignable. (\"[The officials] don't always stick to the same book, yet it\nisn't\n\nthe books they change, but their places, and [they] have to squeeze past one\n\nanother when they change places, because there's so little room.\" \"This\n\nofficial is rarely very like Klamm, and if he were sitting in his own office\nat\n\nhis own desk with his name on the door I would have no more doubt at\n\nall,\"\n\n26\n\nsays Barnabas, whose dream would be a uniquely molar\n\nsegmen-tarity, no matter how rigid and horrendous, as the only guarantee\n\nof certainty and security. But he cannot but notice that the molar\n\nsegments are necessarily immersed in the molecular soup that nourishes\n\nthem and makes their outlines waver.) And every power center has this\n\nmicrotexture. The microtextures\u2014not masochism\u2014are what explain how\n\nthe oppressed can take an active role in oppression: the workers of the\n\nrich nations actively participate in the exploitation of the Third World,\n\nthe arming of dictatorships, and the pollution of the atmosphere.\n\nThis is not surprising since the texture lies between the line of\n\novercoding with rigid segments and the ultimate quantum line. It continu-\n\nally swings between the two, now channeling the quantum line back into\n\nthe segmented line, now causing flows and quanta to escape from the seg-\n\nmented line. This is the third aspect of power centers, or their limit. For\nthe\n\nonly purpose these centers have is to translate as best they can flow quanta\n\ninto line segments (only segments are totalizable, in one way or another).\n\nBut this is both the principle of their power and the basis of their impo-\n\ntence. Far from being opposites, power and impotence complement and\n\nreinforce each other in a kind of fascinating satisfaction that is found above\n\nall in the most mediocre Statesmen, and defines their \"glory.\" For they\n\nextract glory from their shortsightedness, and power from their impotence,\n\nbecause it confirms that there is no choice. The only \"great\" Statesmen are\n\nthose who connect with flows, like pilot-signs or particles-signs, and who\n\nemit quanta that get out of the black holes: it is not by chance that these\n\nmen encounter each other only on lines of flight, in the act of drawing\n\nthem, sounding them out, following them, or forging ahead of them, even\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)247.png)\n\n0\n\n226 \u25a1\n\n1933: MICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY\n\nthough they may make a mistake and take a fall (Moses the Hebrew,\n\nGenseric the Vandal, Genghis the Mongol, Mao the Chinese . . .). But there\n\nis no Power regulating the flows themselves. No one dominates the growth\n\nof the \"monetary mass,\" or money supply. If an image of the master or an\n\nidea of the State is projected outward to the limits of the universe, as if\n\nsomething had domination over flows as well as segments, and in the same\n\nmanner, the result is a fictitious and ridiculous representation. The stock\n\nexchange gives a better image of flows and their quanta than does the State.\n\nCapitalists may be the masters of surplus value and its distribution, but\n\nthey do not dominate the flows from which surplus value derives. Rather,\n\npower centers function at the points where flows are converted into seg-\n\nments: they are exchangers, converters, oscillators. Not that the segments\n\nthemselves are governed by a decision-making power. We have seen, on the\n\ncontrary, that segments (classes, for example) form at the conjunction of\n\nmasses and deterritorialized flows and that the most deterritorialized flow\n\ndetermines the dominant segment; thus the dollar segment dominates cur-\n\nrency, the bourgeoisie dominates capitalism, etc. Segments, then, are\n\nthemselves governed by an abstract machine. But what power centers gov-\n\nern are the assemblages that effectuate that abstract machine, in other\n\nwords, that continually adapt variations in mass and flow to the segments\n\nof the rigid line, as a function of a dominant segment and dominated seg-\n\nments. Much perverse invention can enter into the adaptations.\n\nThis is the sense in which we would speak, for example, of banking\n\npower (the World Bank, central banks, credit banks): if the flow of\n\nfinancing-money, or credit money, involves the mass of economic transac-\n\ntions, what banks govern is the conversion of the credit money that has\n\nbeen _created _into segmentary payment-money that is _appropriated, _in\n\nother words, coinage or State money for the purchase of goods that are\n\nthemselves segmented (the importance of the interest rate in this respect).\n\nWhat banks govern is the conversion between the two kinds of money, and\n\nthe conversion of the segments of the second kind into any given good.\n\n27\n\nThe same could be said of every central power. Every central power has\n\nthree aspects or zones: (1) its zone of power, relating to the segments of a\n\nsolid rigid line; (2) its zone of indiscernibility, relating to its diffusion\n\nthroughout a microphysical fabric; (3) its zone of impotence, relatingto the\n\nflows and quanta it can only convert without being able to control or\n\ndefine. It is always from the depths of its impotence that each power center\n\ndraws its power, hence their extreme maliciousness, and vanity. Better to\n\nbe a tiny quantum flow than a molar converter, oscillator, or distributor!\n\nReturning to the example of money, the first zone is represented by the\n\npublic central banks; the second by the \"indefinite series of private rela-\n\ntions between banks and borrowers\"; the third by the desiring flow of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)248.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY \u25a1 227\n\nmoney, whose quanta are defined by the mass of economic transactions. It\n\nis true that the same problems are reformulated at the level of these very\n\ntransactions, in relation to other power centers. But the first zone of the\n\npower center is always defined by the State apparatus, which is the assem-\n\nblage that effectuates the abstract machine of molar overcoding; the sec-\n\nond is defined in the molecular fabric immersing this assemblage; the third\n\nby the abstract machine of mutation, flows, and quanta.\n\nWe cannot say that one of these three lines is bad and another good, by\n\nnature and necessarily. The study of the dangers of each line is the object of\n\npragmatics or schizoanalysis, to the extent that it undertakes not to repre-\n\nsent, interpret, or symbolize, but only to make maps and draw lines, mark-\n\ning their mixtures as well as their distinctions. According to Nietzsche's\n\nZarathustra and Castaneda's Indian Don Juan, there are three or even four\n\ndangers: first, Fear, then Clarity, then Power, and finally the great Disgust,\n\nthe longing to kill and to die, the Passion for abolition.\n\n28\n\nWe can guess what\n\nfear is. We are always afraid of losing. Our security, the great molar organi-\n\nzation that sustains us, the arborescences we cling to, the binary machines\n\nthat give us a well-defined status, the resonances we enter into, the system\n\nof overcoding that dominates us\u2014we desire all that. \"The values, morals,\n\nfatherlands, religions and private certitudes our vanity and self-compla-\n\ncency generously grant us are so many abodes the world furnishes for those\n\nwho think on that account that they stand and rest amid stable things; they\n\nknow nothing of the enormous rout they are heading for... _in flight from  \nflight.\"_\n\n_29_\n\n_ _We flee from flight, rigidify our segments, give ourselves over to\n\nbinary logic; the harder they have been to us on one segment, the harder we\n\nwill be on another; we reterritorialize on anything available; the only\n\nsegmentarity we know is molar, at the level of the large-scale aggregates we\n\nbelong to, as well as at the level of the little groups we get into, as well\nas at\n\nthe level of what goes on in our most intimate and private recesses. Every-\n\nthing is involved: modes of perception, kinds of actions, ways of moving,\n\nlife-styles, semiotic regimes.

The more rigid the segmentarity, the\n\nmore reassuring it is for us. That is what fear is, and how it makes us\nretreat\n\ninto the first line.\n\nThe second danger, Clarity, seems less obvious. Clarity, in effect, con-\n\ncerns the molecular. Once again, everything is involved, even perception,\n\neven the semiotic regime, but this time on the second line.

That is precisely what clarity is: the distinctions that\n\nappear in what used to seem full, the holes in what used to be compact; and\n\nconversely, where just before we saw end points of clear-cut segments, now\n\nthere are indistinct fringes, encroachments, overlappings, migrations, acts\n\nof segmentation that no longer coincide with the rigid segmentarity. Every-\n\nthing now appears supple, with holes in fullness, nebulas in forms, and flut-\n\nter in lines. Everything has the clarity of the microscope. We think we have\n\nunderstood everything, and draw conclusions. We are the new knights; we\n\neven have a mission. A microphysics of the migrant has replaced the\n\nmacrogeometry of the sedentary. But this suppleness and clarity do not\n\nonly present dangers, they are themselves a danger. First, supple segmen-\n\ntarity runs the risk of reproducing in miniature the affections, the affecta-\n\ntions, of the rigid: the family is replaced by a community, conjugality by a\n\nregime of exchange and migration; worse, micro-Oedipuses crop up,\n\nmicrofascisms lay down the law, the mother feels obliged to titillate her\n\nchild, the father becomes a mommy. A dark light that falls from no star and\n\nemanates such sadness: this shifting segmentarity derives directly from the\n\nmost rigid, for which it is indirect compensation. The more molar the\n\naggregates become, the more molecular become their elements and the\n\nrelations between their elements: molecular man for molar humanity. One\n\ndeterritorializes, massifies, but only in order to knot and annul the mass\n\nmovements and movements of deterritorialization, to invent all kinds of\n\nmarginal reterritorializations even worse than the others. But above all,\n\nsupple segmentarity brings dangers of its own that do not merely reproduce\n\nin small scale the dangers of molar segmentarity, which do not derive from\n\nthem or compensate for them.

It stretches from the rigid segments with their overcoding and reso-\n\nnance to the fine segmentations with their diffusion and interactions, and\n\nback again. Every man of power jumps from one line to the other, alternat-\n\ning between a petty and a lofty style, the rogue's style and the grandiloquent\n\nstyle, drugstore demagoguery and the imperialism of the high-ranking gov-\n\nernment man. But this whole chain and web of power is immersed in a\n\nworld of mutant flows that eludes them. It is precisely its impotence that\n\nmakes power so dangerous. The man of power will always want to stop the\n\nlines of flight, and to this end to trap and stabilize the mutation machine in\n\nthe overcoding machine. But he can do so only by creating a void, in other\n\nwords, by first stabilizing the overcoding machine itself by containing it\n\nwithin the local assemblage charged with effectuating it, in short, by giving\n\nthe assemblage the dimensions of the machine. This is what takes place in\n\nthe artificial conditions of totalitarianism or the \"closed vessel.\"\n\nBut there is a fourth danger as well, and this is the one that interests us\n\nmost, because it concerns the lines of flight themselves. We may well have\n\npresented these lines as a sort of mutation or creation drawn not only in the\n\nimagination but also in the very fabric of social reality; we may well have\n\nattributed to them the movement of the arrow and the speed of an\n\nabsolute\u2014but it would be oversimplifying to believe that the only risk they\n\nfear and confront is allowing themselves to be recaptured in the end, letting\n\nthemselves be sealed in, tied up, reknotted, reterritorialized. They them-\n\nselves emanate a strange despair, like an odor of death and immolation, a\n\nstate of war from which one returns broken: they have their own dangers\n\ndistinct from the ones previously discussed. This is exactly what led\n\nFitzgerald to say: \"I had a feeling that I was standing at twilight on a\n\ndeserted range, with an empty rifle in my hands and the targets down. No\n\nproblem set\u2014simply a silence with only the sound of my own breathing.\n\n... My self-immolation was something sodden-dark.\"\n\n30\n\nWhy is the line of\n\nflight a war one risks coming back from defeated, destroyed, after having\n\ndestroyed everything one could? This, precisely, is the fourth danger: the\n\nline of flight crossing the wall, getting out of the black holes, but instead\nof\n\nconnecting with other lines and each time augmenting its valence, _turning  \nto destruction, abolition pure and simple, the passion of abolition. _Like\n\nKleist's line of flight, and the strange war he wages; like suicide, double\nsui-\n\ncide, a way out that turns the line of flight into a line of death.\n\nWe are not invoking any kind of death drive.

It is of nomadic\nori-\n\ngin and is directed against the State apparatus. One of the fundamental\n\nproblems of the State is to appropriate this war machine that is foreign to it\n\nand make it a piece in its apparatus, in the form of a stable military\ninstitu-\n\ntion; and the State has always encountered major difficulties in this. It is\n\nprecisely when the war machine has reached the point that it has no other\n\nobject but war, it is when it substitutes destruction for mutation, that it\n\nfrees the most catastrophic charge. Mutation is in no way a transformation\n\nof war; on the contrary, war is like the fall or failure of mutation, the only\n\nobject left for the war machine after it has lost its power to change. War, it\n\nmust be said, is only the abominable residue of the war machine, either\n\nafter it has allowed itself to be appropriated by the State apparatus, or even\n\nworse, has constructed itself a State apparatus capable only of destruction.\n\nWhen this happens, the war machine no longer draws mutant lines of\n\nflight, but a pure, cold line of abolition. (Later, we will propose a theory\nof\n\nthe complex relation between the war machine and war.)\n\n31\n\nThis brings us back to the paradox of fascism, and the way in which fas-\n\ncism differs from totalitarianism. For totalitarianism is a State affair: it\n\nessentially concerns the relation between the State as a localized assem-\n\nblage and the abstract machine of overcoding it effectuates. Even in the\n\ncase of a military dictatorship, it is a State army, not a war machine, that\n\ntakes power and elevates the State to the totalitarian stage. Totalitarianism\n\nis quintessentially conservative. Fascism, on the other hand, involves a war\n\nmachine. When fascism builds itself a totalitarian State, it is not in the\n\nsense of a State army taking power, but of a war machine taking over the\n\nState. A bizarre remark by Virilio puts us on the trail: in fascism, the State\n\nis far less totalitarian than it is _suicidal. _There is in fascism a realized\nnihil-\n\nism. Unlike the totalitarian State, which does its utmost to seal all possible\n\nlines of flight, fascism is constructed on an intense line of flight, which it\n\ntransforms into a line of pure destruction and abolition. It is curious that\n\nfrom the very beginning the Nazis announced to Germany what they were\n\nbringing: at once wedding bells and death, including their own death, and\n\nthe death of the Germans. They thought they would perish but that their\n\nundertaking would be resumed, all across Europe, all over the world,\n\nthroughout the solar system. And the people cheered, not because they did\n\nnot understand, but because they wanted that death through the death of\n\nothers. Like a will to wager everything you have every hand, to stake your\n\nown death against the death of others, and measure everything by\n\n\"deleometers.\" Klaus Mann's novel, _Mephisto, _gives samplings of entirely\n\nordinary Nazi speeches and conversations: \"Heroism was something that\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)252.png)\n\n0\n\n1933:\n\nMICROPOLITICS AND SEGMENTARITY D 231\n\nwas being ruled out of our lives. . . .

They always contain the \"stupid and\n\nrepugnant\" cry, _Long live death!, _even at the economic level, where the\n\narms expansion replaces growth in consumption and where investment\n\nveers from the means of production toward the means of pure destruction.\n\nPaul Virilio's analysis strikes us as entirely correct in defining fascism not\n\nby the notion of the totalitarian State but by the notion of the suicidal\nState:\n\nso-called total war seems less a State undertaking than an undertaking of a\n\nwar machine that appropriates the State and channels into it a flow of abso-\n\nlute war whose only possible outcome is the suicide of the State itself. \"The\n\ntriggering of a hitherto unknown material process, one that is limitless and\n\naimless. . . .

My memory of it is not necessarily accurate. I will\n\nrecount the story in broad outline. Willard lives with his authoritarian\n\nmother in the old family house. Dreadful Oedipal atmosphere. His mother\n\norders him to destroy a litter of rats. He spares one (or two or several).\nAfter\n\na violent argument, the mother, who \"resembles\" a dog, dies. The house is\n\ncoveted by a businessman, and Willard is in danger of losing it. He likes the\n\nprincipal rat he saved, Ben, who proves to be of prodigious intelligence.\n\nThere is also a white female rat, Ben's companion. Willard spends all his\n\nfree time with them. They multiply. Willard takes the rat pack, led by Ben,\n\nto the home of the businessman, who is put to a terrible death. But he fool-\n\nishly takes his two favorites to the office with him and has no choice but to\n\nlet the employees kill the white rat. Ben escapes, after throwing Willard a\n\nlong, hard glare. Willard then experiences a pause in his destiny, in his  \n_becoming-rat. _He tries with all his might to remain among humans. He\n\neven responds to the advances of a young woman in the office who bears a\n\nstrong \"resemblance\" to a rat\u2014but it is only a resemblance. One day when\n\nhe has invited the young woman over, all set to be conjugalized,\n\nreoedi-palized, Ben suddenly reappears, full of hate. Willard tries to\n\ndrive him away, but succeeds only in driving away the young woman: he\n\nthen is lured to the basement by Ben, where a pack of countless rats is\n\nwaiting to tear him to shreds. It is like a tale; it is never disturbing.\n\nIt is all there: there is a becoming-animal not content to proceed by\n\nresemblance and for which resemblance, on the contrary, would represent\n\nan obstacle or stoppage; the proliferation of rats, the pack, brings a\n\nbecoming-molecular that undermines the great molar powers of family,\n\ncareer, and conjugality; there is a sinister choice since there is a\n\"favorite\"\n\nin the pack with which a kind of contract of alliance, a hideous pact, is\n\nmade; there is the institution of an assemblage, a war machine or criminal\n\nmachine, which can reach the point of self-destruction; there is a circula-\n\ntion of impersonal affects, an alternate current that disrupts signifying\n\nprojects as well as subjective feelings, and constitutes a nonhuman sexual-\n\nity; and there is an irresistible deterritorialization that forestalls\nattempts\n\nat professional, conjugal, or Oedipal reterritorialization. (Are there Oedi-\n\npal animals with which one can \"play Oedipus,\" play family, my little dog,\n\nmy little cat, and then other animals that by contrast draw us into an irre-\n\nsistible becoming?

As we know, evolutionism would\n\narrive at the idea of an evolution that does not necessarily operate by\n\nfiliation. But it was unavoidable that it begin with the genealogical motif.\n\nDarwin himself treats the evolutionist theme of kinship and the naturalist\n\ntheme of the sum and value of differences or resemblances as very separate\n\nthings: groups that are equally related can display highly variable degrees\n\nof difference with respect to the ancestor. Precisely because natural history\n\nis concerned primarily with the sum and value of differences, it can con-\n\nceive of progressions and regressions, continuities and major breaks, but\n\nnot an evolution in the strict sense, in other words, the possibility of a\n\ndescent the _degrees _of modification of which depend on external condi-\n\ntions. Natural history can think only in terms of relationships (between A\n\nand B), not in terms of production (from A to _x)._\n\nBut something very important transpires at the level of relationships.\n\nFor natural history conceives of the relationships between animals in two\n\nways: series and structure. In the case of a series, I say _a _resembles _b, b\n_\n\nresembles _c, _etc.; all of these terms conform in varying degrees to a\nsingle,\n\neminent term, perfection, or quality as the principle behind the series. This\n\nis exactly what the theologians used to call an analogy of proportion. In the\n\ncase of a structure, I say _a _is to _b _as _c _is to _d; _and each of these\nrelationships\n\nrealizes after its fashion the perfection under consideration: gills are to\n\nbreathing under water as lungs are to breathing air; or the heart is to gills\nas\n\nthe absence of a heart is to tracheas [in insects]. . . This is an analogy of\npro-\n\nportionality. In the first case, I have resemblances that differ from one\n\nanother in a single series, and between series. In the second case, I have\ndif-\n\nferences that resemble each other within a single structure, and between\n\nstructures. The first form of analogy passes for the most sensible and popu-\n\nlar, and requires imagination; but the kind of imagination it requires is a\n\nstudious one that has to take branchings in the series into account, fill in\n\napparent ruptures, ward off false resemblances and graduate the true ones,\n\nand take both progressions and regressions or degraduations into account.\n\nThe second form of analogy is considered royal because it requires instead\n\nall the resources of understanding _(entendement), _in order to define equiv-\n\nalent relations by discovering, on the one hand, the independent variables\n\nthat can be combined to form a structure and, on the other hand, the corre-\n\nlates that entail one another within each structure. As different as they are,\n\nthe two themes of series and structure have always coexisted in natural his-\n\ntory; in appearance contradictory, in practice they have reached a more or\n\nless stable compromise.\n\n1\n\nIn the same way, the two figures of analogy coex-\n\nisted in the minds of the theologians in various equilibriums. This is\n\nbecause in both cases Nature is conceived as an enormous _mimesis: _either\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)257.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 235\n\nin the form of a chain of beings perpetually imitating one another, progres-\n\nsively and regressively, and tending toward the divine higher term they all\n\nimitate by graduated resemblance, as the model for and principle behind\n\nthe series; or in the form of a mirror Imitation with nothing left to imitate\n\nbecause it itself is the model everything else imitates, this time by ordered\n\ndifference. (This mimetic or mimological vision is what made the idea of\n\nan evolution-production possible at that moment.)\n\nThis problem is in no way behind us. Ideas do not die. Not that they\n\nsurvive simply as archaisms. At a given moment they may reach a scien-\n\ntific stage, and then lose that status or emigrate to other sciences. Their\n\napplication and status, even their form and content, may change; yet they\n\nretain something essential throughout the process, across the displace-\n\nment, in the distribution of a new domain. Ideas are always reusable,\n\nbecause they have been usable before, but in the most varied of actual\n\nmodes. For, on the one hand, the relationships between animals are the\n\nobject not only of science but also of dreams, symbolism, art and poetry,\n\npractice and practical use. And on the other hand, the relationships\n\nbetween animals are bound up with the relations between man and ani-\n\nmal, man and woman, man and child, man and the elements, man and the\n\nphysical and microphysical universe. The twofold idea \"series-structure\"\n\ncrosses a scientific threshold at a certain moment; but it did not start there\n\nand it does not stay there, or else crosses over into other sciences,\n\nanimating, for example, the human sciences, serving in the study of\n\ndreams, myths, and organizations. The history of ideas should never be\n\ncontinuous; it should be wary of resemblances, but also of descents or\n\nfiliations; it should be content to mark the thresholds through which an\n\nidea passes, the journeys it takes that change its nature or object. Yet the\n\nobjective relationships between animals have been applied to certain sub-\n\njective relations between man and animal, from the standpoint of a col-\n\nlective imagination or a faculty of social understanding.\n\nJung elaborated a theory of the Archetype as collective unconscious; it\n\nassigns the animal a particularly important role in dreams, myths, and\n\nhuman collectivities. The animal is inseparable from a _series _exhibiting the\n\ndouble aspect of progression-regression, in which each term plays the role\n\nof a possible transformer of the libido (metamorphosis). A whole approach\n\nto the dream follows from this; given a troubling image, it becomes a ques-\n\ntion of integrating it into its archetypal series. That series may include\nfem-\n\ninine, masculine, or infantile sequences, as well as animal, vegetable, even\n\nelementary or molecular sequences. In contrast to natural history, man is\n\nnow no longer the eminent term of the series; that term may be an animal\n\nfor man, the lion, crab, bird of prey, or louse, in relation to a given act or\n\nfunction, in accordance with a given demand of the unconscious.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)258.png)\n\n236 D 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL .. .\n\nBachelard wrote a fine Jungian book when he elaborated the ramified\n\nseries of Lautreamont, taking into account the speed coefficient of the\n\nmetamorphoses and the degree of perfection of each term in relation to a\n\npure aggressiveness as the principle of the series: the serpent's fang, the\n\nhorn of the rhinoceros, the dog's tooth, the owl's beak; and higher up, the\n\nclaw of the eagle or the vulture, the pincer of the crab, the legs of the\nlouse,\n\nthe suckers of the octopus. Throughout Jung's work a process of mimesis\n\nbrings nature and culture together in its net, by means of analogies of pro-\n\nportion in which the series and their terms, and above all the animals occu-\n\npying a middle position, assure cycles of conversion nature-culture-nature:\n\narchetypes as \"analogical representations.\"\n\n2\n\nIs it by chance that structuralism so strongly denounced the prestige\n\naccorded the imagination, the establishment of resemblances in a series,\n\nthe imitation pervading the entire series and carrying it to its term, and\n\nthe identification with this final term?

It is no longer a question of gradu-\n\nating resemblances, ultimately arriving at an identification between Man\n\nand Animal at the heart of a mystical participation. It is a question of\n\nordering differences to arrive at a correspondence of relations. The ani-\n\nmal is distributed according to differential relations or distinctive oppo-\n\nsitions between species; the same goes for human beings, according to the\n\ngroups considered. When analyzing the institution of the totem, we do\n\nnot say that this group of people identifies with that animal species. We\n\nsay that what group A is to group B, species A' is to species B'. This method\n\nis profoundly different from the preceding one: given two human groups,\n\neach with its totem animal, we must discover the way in which the two\n\ntotems entertain relations analogous to those between the two groups\u2014\n\nthe Crow is to the Falcon ...\n\nThe method also applies to Man-child, man-woman relations, etc. If we\n\nnote, for example, that the warrior has a certain astonishing relation to the\n\nyoung woman, we refrain from establishing an imaginary series tying the\n\ntwo together; instead, we look for a term effecting an equivalence of rela-\n\ntions. Thus Vernant can say that marriage is to the woman what war is to\n\nthe man. The result is a homology between the virgin who refuses marriage\n\nand the warrior who disguises himself as a woman.\n\n4\n\nIn short, symbolic\n\nunderstanding replaces the analogy of proportion with an analogy of pro-\n\nportionality; the serialization of resemblances with a structuration of dif-\n\nferences; the identification of terms with an equality of relations; the\n\nmetamorphoses of the imagination with conceptual metaphors; the great\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)259.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...

Levi-Strauss is not content to grant the structural\n\nmodel all the prestige of a true classification system; he relegates the\nserial\n\nmodel to the dark domain of sacrifice, which he depicts as illusory, even\n\ndevoid of good sense. The _serial theme of sacrifice _must yield to the\n_struc-  \ntural theme of the institution of the totem, _correctly understood.

Above all, becoming does not occur in the  \nimagination, even when the imagination reaches the highest cosmic or  \ndynamic level, as in Jung or Bachelard. Becomings-animal are neither  \ndreams nor phantasies. They are perfectly real. But which reality is at issue  \nhere? For if becoming animal does not consist in playing animal or imitat-  \ning an animal, it is clear that the human being does not \"really\" become an  \nanimal any more than the animal \"really\" becomes something else. Becom-  \ning produces nothing other than itself. We fall into a false alternative if we  \nsay that you either imitate or you are. What is real is the becoming itself,\nthe  \nblock of becoming, not the supposedly fixed terms through which that  \nwhich becomes passes. Becoming can and should be qualified as be-  \ncoming-animal even in the absence of a term that would be the animal  \nbecome. The becoming-animal of the human being is real, even if the ani-  \nmal the human being becomes is not; and the becoming-other of the animal  \nis real, even if that something other it becomes is not. This is the point to  \nclarify: that a becoming lacks a subject distinct from itself; but also that\nit  \nhas no term, since its term in turn exists only as taken up in another becom-  \ning of which it is the subject, and which coexists, forms a block, with the  \nfirst. This is the principle according to which there is a reality specific to  \nbecoming (the Bergsonian idea of a coexistence of very different \"dura-  \ntions,\" superior or inferior to \"ours,\" all of them in communication).\n\nFinally, becoming is not an evolution, at least not an evolution by\n\ndescent and filiation. Becoming produces nothing by filiation; all filiation  \nis imaginary. Becoming is always of a different order than filiation. It con-  \ncerns alliance. If evolution includes any veritable becomings, it is in the  \ndomain of _symbioses _that bring into play beings of totally different scales  \nand kingdoms, with no possible filiation. There is a block of becoming that  \nsnaps up the wasp and the orchid, but from which no wasp-orchid can ever  \ndescend. There is a block of becoming that takes hold of the cat and  \nbaboon, the alliance between which is effected by a C virus. There is a block  \nof becoming between young roots and certain microorganisms, the alliance  \nbetween which is effected by the materials synthesized in the leaves  \n(rhizosphere). If there is originality in neoevolutionism, it is attributable\nin  \npart to phenomena of this kind in which evolution does not go from some-  \nthing less differentiated to something more differentiated, in which it  \nceases to be a hereditary filiative evolution, becoming communicative or  \ncontagious. Accordingly, the term we would prefer for this form of evolu-  \ntion between heterogeneous terms is \"involution,\" on the condition that  \ninvolution is in no way confused with regression. Becoming is  \ninvolu-tionary, involution is creative. To regress is to move in the  \ndirection of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)261.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 239\n\nsomething less differentiated. But to involve is to form a block that runs its\n\nown line \"between\" the terms in play and beneath assignable relations.\n\nNeoevolutionism seems important for two reasons: the animal is\n\ndefined not by characteristics (specific, generic, etc.) but by populations\n\nthat vary from milieu to milieu or within the same milieu; movement\n\noccurs not only, or not primarily, by filiative productions but also by\n\ntransversal communications between heterogeneous populations.\n\nBecoming is a rhizome, not a classificatory or genealogical tree. Becom-\n\ning is certainly not imitating, or identifying with something; neither is it\n\nregressing-progressing; neither is it corresponding, establishing corre-\n\nsponding relations; neither is it producing, producing a filiation or pro-\n\nducing through filiation. Becoming is a verb with a consistency all its\n\nown; it does not reduce to, or lead back to, \"appearing,\" \"being,\" \"equal-\n\ning,\" or \"producing.\"\n\n_**Memories of a Sorcerer, I. **_A becoming-animal always involves a pack, a\n\nband, a population, a peopling, in short, a multiplicity. We sorcerers have\n\nalways known that. It may very well be that other agencies, moreover very\n\ndifferent from one another, have a different appraisal of the animal. One\n\nmay retain or extract from the animal certain characteristics: species and\n\ngenera, forms and functions, etc. Society and the State need animal charac-\n\nteristics to use for classifying people; natural history and science need\nchar-\n\nacteristics in order to classify the animals themselves. Serialism and\n\nstructuralism either graduate characteristics according to their resem-\n\nblances, or order them according to their differences. Animal characteris-\n\ntics can be mythic or scientific. But we are not interested in\ncharacteristics;\n\nwhat interests us are modes of expansion, propagation, occupation, conta-\n\ngion, peopling. I am legion. The Wolf-Man fascinated by several wolves\n\nwatching him. What would a lone wolf be? Or a whale, a louse, a rat, a fly?\n\nBeelzebub is the Devil, but the Devil as lord of the flies. The wolf is not\nfun-\n\ndamentally a characteristic or a certain number of characteristics; it is a\n\nwolfing. The louse is a lousing, and so on. What is a cry independent of the\n\npopulation it appeals to or takes as its witness? Virginia Woolfs experi-\n\nences herself not as a monkey or a fish but as a troop of monkeys, a school of\n\nfish, according to her variable relations of becoming with the people she\n\napproaches. We do not wish to say that certain animals live in packs. We\n\nwant nothing to do with ridiculous evolutionary classifications a la Lorenz,\n\naccording to which there are inferior packs and superior societies. What we\n\nare saying is that every animal is fundamentally a band, a pack. That it has\n\npack modes, rather than characteristics, even if further distinctions within\n\nthese modes are called for. It is at this point that the human being encoun-\n\nters the animal.

A fascination for the outside? Or is the multiplicity\n\nthat fascinates us already related to a multiplicity dwelling within us? In\n\none of his masterpieces, H. P. Lovecraft recounts the story of Randolph\n\nCarter, who feels his \"self reel and who experiences a fear worse than that\n\nof annihilation: \"Carters of forms both human and non-human, vertebrate\n\nand invertebrate, conscious and mindless, animal and vegetable. And\n\nmore, there were Carters having nothing in common with earthly life, but\n\nmoving outrageously amidst backgrounds of other planets and systems\n\nand galaxies and cosmic continua. .. . Merging with nothingness is peace-\n\nful oblivion; but to be aware of existence and yet to know that one is no\n\nlonger a definite being distinguished from other beings,\" nor from all of the\n\nbecomings running through us, \"that is the nameless summit of agony and\n\ndread.\"\n\n7\n\nHofmannsthal, or rather Lord Chandos, becomes fascinated with\n\na \"people\" of dying rats, and it is in him, through him, in the interstices of\n\nhis disrupted self that the \"soul of the animal bares its teeth at monsterous\n\nfate\":\n\n8\n\nnot pity, but _unnatural participation. _Then a strange imperative\n\nwells up in him: either stop writing, or write like a rat. . . If the writer\nis a\n\nsorcerer, it is because writing is a becoming, writing is traversed by strange\n\nbecomings that are not becomings-writer, but becomings-rat,\n\nbecomings-insect, becomings-wolf, etc. We will have to explain why. Many\n\nsuicides by writers are explained by these unnatural participations, these\n\nunnatural nuptials. Writers are sorcerers because they experience the\n\nanimal as the only population before which they are responsible in\n\nprinciple. The German preromantic Karl Philipp Moritz feels responsible\n\nnot for the calves that die but before the calves that die and give him the\n\nincredible feeling of an unknown Nature\u2014_affect? _For the affect is not a\n\npersonal feeling, nor is it a characteristic; it is the effectuation of a\npower\n\nof the pack that throws the self into upheaval and makes it reel. Who has\n\nnot known the violence of these animal sequences, which uproot one from\n\nhumanity, if only for an instant, making one scrape at one's bread like a\n\nrodent or giving one the yellow eyes of a feline? A fearsome involution\n\ncalling us toward unheard-of becomings. These are not regressions,\n\nalthough fragments of regression, sequences of regression may enter in.\n\nWe must distinguish three kinds of animals. First, individuated ani-\n\nmals, family pets, sentimental, Oedipal animals each with its own petty\n\nhistory, \"my\" cat, \"my\" dog. These animals invite us to regress, draw us\n\ninto a narcissistic contemplation, and they are the only kind of animal psy-\n\nchoanalysis understands, the better to discover a daddy, a mommy, a little\n\nbrother behind them (when psychoanalysis talks about animals, animals\n\nlearn to laugh): _anyone who likes cats or dogs is a fool. _And then there is\na\n\nsecond kind: animals with characteristics or attributes; genus, classifica-\n\ntion, or State animals; animals as they are treated in the great divine myths,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)263.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 241\n\nin such a way as to extract from them series or structures, archetypes or\n\nmodels (Jung is in any event profounder than Freud). Finally, there are\n\nmore demonic animals, pack or affect animals that form a multiplicity, a\n\nbecoming, a population, a tale . . . Or once again, cannot any animal be\n\ntreated in all three ways? There is always the possibility that a given\nanimal,\n\na louse, a cheetah or an elephant, will be treated as a pet, my little beast.\n\nAnd at the other extreme, it is also possible for any animal to be treated in\n\nthe mode of the pack or swarm; that is our way, fellow sorcerers. Even the\n\ncat, even the dog. And the shepherd, the animal trainer, the Devil, may\n\nhave a favorite animal in the pack, although not at all in the way we were\n\njust discussing. Yes, any animal is or can be a pack, but to varying degrees\n\nof vocation that make it easier or harder to discover the multiplicity, or\n\nmultiplicity-grade, an animal contains (actually or virtually according to\n\nthe case). Schools, bands, herds, populations are not inferior social forms;\n\nthey are affects and powers, involutions that grip every animal in a becom-\n\ning just as powerful as that of the human being with the animal.\n\nJorge Luis Borges, an author renowned for his excess of culture, botched\n\nat least two books, only the titles of which are nice: first, _A Universal\nHis-  \ntory of Infamy, _because he did not see the sorcerer's fundamental distinc-\n\ntion between deception and treason (becomings-animal are there from the\n\nstart, on the treason side); second, his _Manual de zoolog'iafantastica,\n_where\n\nhe not only adopts a composite and bland image of myth but also elimi-\n\nnates all of the problems of the pack and the corresponding\n\nbecoming-animal of the human being: \"We have deliberately excluded\n\nfrom this manual legends of transformations of the human being, the  \n_lobizbn, _the werewolf, etc.\"\n\n10\n\nBorges is interested only in characteristics,\n\neven the most fantastic ones, whereas sorcerers know that werewolves are\n\nbands, and vampires too, and that bands transform themselves into one\n\nanother. But what exactly does that mean, the animal as band or pack?\n\nDoes a band not imply a filiation, bringing us back to the reproduction of\n\ngiven characteristics? How can we conceive of a peopling, a propagation, a\n\nbecoming that is without filiation or hereditary production? A multiplicity\n\nwithout the unity of an ancestor? It is quite simple; everybody knows it,\n\nbut it is discussed only in secret. We oppose epidemic to filiation,\n\ncontagion to heredity, peopling by contagion to sexual reproduction,\n\nsexual production. Bands, human or animal, proliferate by contagion,\n\nepidemics, battlefields, and catastrophes. Like hybrids, which are in\n\nthemselves sterile, born of a sexual union that will not reproduce itself,\n\nbut which begins over again every time, gaining that much more ground.\n\nUnnatural participations or nuptials are the true Nature spanning the\n\nkingdoms of nature. Propagation by epidemic, by contagion, has nothing\n\nto do with filiation by heredity, even if the two themes intermingle and\n\nrequire each other.

The difference is that contagion, epidemic,\n\ninvolves terms that are entirely heterogeneous: for example, a human\n\nbeing, an animal, and a bacterium, a virus, a molecule, a microorganism.\n\nOr in the case of the truffle, a tree, a fly, and a pig. These combinations\nare\n\nneither genetic nor structural; they are interkingdoms, unnatural partici-\n\npations. That is the only way Nature operates\u2014against itself. This is a far\n\ncry from filiative production or hereditary reproduction, in which the only\n\ndifferences retained are a simple duality between sexes within the same\n\nspecies, and small modifications across generations. For us, on the other\n\nhand, there are as many sexes as there are terms in symbiosis, as many dif-\n\nferences as elements contributing to a process of contagion. We know that\n\nmany beings pass between a man and a woman; they come from different\n\nworlds, are borne on the wind, form rhizomes around roots; they cannot be\n\nunderstood in terms of production, only in terms of becoming. The Uni-\n\nverse does not function by filiation. All we are saying is that animals are\n\npacks, and that packs form, develop, and are transformed by contagion.\n\nThese multiplicities with heterogeneous terms, cofunctioning by conta-\n\ngion, enter certain _assemblages; _it is there that human beings effect their\n\nbecomings-animal. But we should not confuse these dark assemblages,\n\nwhich stir what is deepest within us, with organizations such as the institu-\n\ntion of the family and the State apparatus. We could cite hunting societies,\n\nwar societies, secret societies, crime societies, etc. Becomings-animal are\n\nproper to them. We will not expect to find filiative regimes of the family\n\ntype or modes of classification and attribution of the State or pre-State\n\ntype or even serial organizations of the religious type. Despite appearances\n\nand possible confusions, this is not the site of origin or point of\napplication\n\nfor myths. These are tales, or narratives and statements of becoming. It is\n\ntherefore absurd to establish a hierarchy even of animal collectivities from\n\nthe standpoint of a whimsical evolutionism according to which packs are\n\nlower on the scale and are superseded by State or familial societies. On the\n\ncontrary, there is a difference in nature. The origin of packs is entirely\ndif-\n\nferent from that of families and States; they continually work them from\n\nwithin and trouble them from without, with other forms of content, other\n\nforms of expression. The pack is simultaneously an animal reality, and the\n\nreality of the becoming-animal of the human being; contagion is simulta-\n\nneously an animal peopling, and the propagation of the animal peopling of\n\nthe human being. The hunting machine, the war machine, the crime\n\nmachine entail all kinds of becomings-animal that are not articulated in\n\nmyth, _still less in totemism. _Dumezil showed that becomings of this kind\n\npertain essentially to the man of war, but only insofar as he is external to\n\nfamilies and States, insofar as he upsets filiations and classifications. The\n\nwar machine is always exterior to the State, even when the State uses it,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)265.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

The man of war has an entire becoming that implies multi-\n\nplicity, celerity, ubiquity, metamorphosis and treason, the power of affect.\n\nWolf-men, bear-men, wildcat-men, men of every animality, secret brother-\n\nhoods, animate the battlefields. But so do the animal packs used by men in\n\nbattle, or which trail the battles and take advantage of them. And together\n\nthey spread contagion.\n\n11\n\nThere is a complex aggregate: the\n\nbecoming-animal of men, packs of animals, elephants and rats, winds and\n\ntempests, bacteria sowing contagion. A single _Furor. _War contained\n\nzoological sequences before it became bacteriological. It is in war, famine,\n\nand epidemic that werewolves and vampires proliferate. Any animal can\n\nbe swept up in these packs and the corresponding becomings; cats have\n\nbeen seen on the battlefield, and even in armies. That is why the distinction\n\nwe must make is less between kinds of animals than between the different\n\nstates according to which they are integrated into family institutions,\n\nState apparatuses, war machines, etc. (and what is the relation of the\n\nwriting machine and the musical machine to becomings-animal?)\n\n_Memories of a Sorcerer, II. _Our first principle was: pack and contagion,\n\nthe contagion of the pack, such is the path becoming-animal takes. But a\n\nsecond principle seemed to tell us the opposite: wherever there is multipli-\n\ncity, you will also find an exceptional individual, and it is with that\nindivid-\n\nual that an alliance must be made in order to become-animal. There may be\n\nno such thing as a lone wolf, but there is a leader of the pack, a master of\nthe\n\npack, or else the old deposed head of the pack now living alone, there is the\n\nLoner, and there is the Demon. Willard has his favorite, the rat Ben, and\n\nonly becomes-rat through his relation with him, in a kind of alliance of\n\nlove, then of hate. _Moby-Dick _in its entirety is one of the greatest master-\n\npieces of becoming; Captain Ahab has an irresistible becoming-whale, but\n\none that bypasses the pack or the school, operating directly through a mon-\n\nstrous alliance with the Unique, the Leviathan, Moby-Dick. There is\n\nalways a pact with a demon; the demon sometimes appears as the head of\n\nthe band, sometimes as the Loner on the sidelines of the pack, and some-\n\ntimes as the higher Power _(Puissance) _of the band. The exceptional individ-\n\nual has many possible positions. Kafka, another great author of real\n\nbecomings-animal, sings of mouse society; but Josephine, the mouse\n\nsinger, sometimes holds a privileged position in the pack, sometimes a\n\nposition outside the pack, and sometimes slips into and is lost in the ano-\n\nnymity of the collective statements of the pack.\n\n12\n\nIn short, every Animal\n\nhas its Anomalous. Let us clarify that: every animal swept up in its pack or\n\nmultiplicity has its anomalous. It has been noted that the origin of the word  \n_anomal _(\"anomalous\"), an adjective that has fallen into disuse in French,\n\nis very different from that of _anormal _(\"abnormal\"): _a-normal, _a Latin\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)266.png)\n\n0\n\n244 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nadjective lacking a noun in French, refers to that which is outside rules or\n\ngoes against the rules, whereas _an-omalie, _a Greek noun that has lost its\n\nadjective, designates the unequal, the coarse, the rough, the cutting edge of\n\ndeterritorialization.\n\n13\n\nThe abnormal can be defined only in terms of char-\n\nacteristics, specific or generic; but the anomalous is a position or set of\n\npositions in relation to a multiplicity. Sorcerers therefore use the old\nadjec-\n\ntive \"anomalous\" to situate the positions of the exceptional individual in\n\nthe pack. It is always with the Anomalous, Moby-Dick or Josephine, that\n\none enters into alliance to become-animal.\n\nIt does seem as though there is a contradiction: between the pack and the\n\nloner; between mass contagion and preferential alliance; between pure\n\nmultiplicity and the exceptional individual; between the aleatory aggre-\n\ngate and a predestined choice. And the contradiction is real: Ahab chooses\n\nMoby-Dick, in a choosing that exceeds him and comes from elsewhere, and\n\nin so doing breaks with the law of the whalers according to which one\n\nshould first pursue the pack. Penthesilea shatters the law of the pack, the\n\npack of women, the pack of she-dogs, by choosing Achilles as her favorite\n\nenemy. Yet it is by means of this anomalous choice that each enters into his\n\nor her becoming-animal, the becoming-dog of Penthesilea, the\n\nbecoming-whale of Captain Ahab. We sorcerers know quite well that the\n\ncontradictions are real but that real contradictions are not just for laughs.\n\nFor the whole question is this: What exactly is the nature of the\n\nanomalous? What function does it have in relation to the band, to the pack?\n\nIt is clear that the anomalous is not simply an exceptional individual; that\n\nwould be to equate it with the family animal or pet, the Oedipalized animal\n\nas psychoanalysis sees it, as the image of the father, etc. Ahab's Moby-Dick\n\nis not like the little cat or dog owned by an elderly woman who honors\n\nand cherishes it. Lawrence's becoming-tortoise has nothing to do with a\n\nsentimental or domestic relation. Lawrence is another of the writers who\n\nleave us troubled and filled with admiration because they were able to tie\n\ntheir writing to real and unheard-of becomings. But the objection is raised\n\nagainst Lawrence: \"Your tortoises aren't real!\" And he answers: Possibly,\n\nbut my becoming is, my becoming is real, even and especially if you have\n\nno way of judging it, because you're just little house dogs . . .\n\n14\n\nThe\n\nanomalous, the preferential element in the pack, has nothing to do with\n\nthe preferred, domestic, and psychoanalytic individual. Nor is the\n\nanomalous the bearer of a species presenting specific or generic\n\ncharacteristics in their purest state; nor is it a model or unique specimen;\n\nnor is it the perfection of a type incarnate; nor is it the eminent term of a\n\nseries; nor is it the basis of an absolutely harmonious correspondence. The\n\nanomalous is neither an individual nor a species; it has only affects, it has\n\nneither familiar or subjectified feelings, nor specific or significant\n\ncharacteristics. Human tenderness is as foreign to it\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)267.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

Lovecraft applies the term \"Outsider\" to this\n\nthing or entity, the Thing, which arrives and passes at the edge, which is\nlin-\n\near yet multiple, \"teeming, seething, swelling, foaming, spreading like an\n\ninfectious disease, this nameless horror.\"\n\nIf the anomalous is neither an individual nor a species, then what is it? It\n\nis a phenomenon, but a phenomenon of bordering. This is our hypothesis:\n\na multiplicity is defined not by the elements that compose it in extension,\n\nnot by the characteristics that compose it in comprehension, but by the\n\nlines and dimensions it encompasses in \"intension.\" If you change dimen-\n\nsions, if you add or subtract one, you change multiplicity. Thus there is a\n\nborderline for each multiplicity; it is in no way a center but rather the\nenvel-\n\noping line or farthest dimension, as a function of which it is possible to\n\ncount the others, all those lines or dimensions constitute the pack at a given\n\nmoment (beyond the borderline, the multiplicity changes nature). That is\n\nwhat Captain Ahab says to his first mate: I have no personal history with\n\nMoby-Dick, no revenge to take, any more than I have a myth to play out;\n\nbut I do have a becoming! Moby-Dick is neither an individual nor a genus;\n\nhe is the borderline, and I have to strike him to get at the pack as a whole,\nto\n\nreach the pack as a whole and pass beyond it. The elements of the pack are\n\nonly imaginary \"dummies,\" the characteristics of the pack are only sym-\n\nbolic entities; all that counts is the borderline\u2014the anomalous. \"To me,\n\nthe white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.\" The white wall. \"Some-\n\ntimes I think there is naught beyond. But 'tis enough.\"\n\n15\n\nThat the anoma-\n\nlous is the borderline makes it easier for us to understand the various\n\npositions it occupies in relation to the pack or the multiplicity it borders,\n\nand the various positions occupied by a fascinated Self _(Moi). _It is now\n\neven possible to establish a classification system for packs while avoiding\n\nthe pitfalls of an evolutionism that sees them only as an inferior collective\n\nstage (instead of taking into consideration the particular assemblages they\n\nbring into play). In any event, the pack has a borderline, and an anomalous\n\nposition, whenever in a given space an animal is on the line or in the act of\n\ndrawing the line in relation to which all the other members of the pack will\n\nfall into one of two halves, left or right: a peripheral position, such that\nit is\n\nimpossible to tell if the anomalous is still in the band, already outside the\n\nband, or at the shifting boundary of the band. Sometimes each and every\n\nanimal reaches this line or occupies this dynamic position, as in a swarm of\n\nmosquitoes, where \"each individual moves randomly unless it sees the rest\n\nof [the swarm] in the same half-space; then it hurries to re-enter the group.\n\nThus stability is assured in catastrophe by a _barrier.\"**' _Sometimes it is a\n\nspecific animal that draws and occupies the borderline, as leader of the\n\npack.

It is true that bands are also undermined by\n\nextremely varied forces that establish in them interior centers of the conju-\n\ngal, familial, or State type, and that make them pass into an entirely differ-\n\nent form of sociability, replacing pack affects with family feelings or State\n\nintelligibilities. The center, or internal black holes, assumes the principal\n\nrole. This is what evolutionism sees as progress, this adventure also befalls\n\nbands of humans when they reconstitute group familialism, or even\n\nauthoritarianism or pack fascism.\n\nSorcerers have always held the anomalous position, at the edge of the\n\nfields or woods. They haunt the fringes. They are at the borderline of the\n\nvillage, or _between _villages. The important thing is their affinity with\nalli-\n\nance, with the pact, which gives them a status opposed to that of filiation.\n\nThe relation with the anomalous is one of alliance. The sorcerer has a\n\nrelation of alliance with the demon as the power of the anomalous. The\n\nold-time theologians drew a clear distinction between two kinds of curses\n\nagainst sexuality. The first concerns sexuality as a process of filiation\n\ntransmitting the original sin. But the second concerns it as a power of alli-\n\nance inspiring illicit unions or abominable loves. This differs signifi-\n\ncantly from the first in that it tends to prevent procreation; since the\n\ndemon does not himself have the ability to procreate, he must adopt indi-\n\nrect means (for example, being the female succubus of a man and then\n\nbecoming the male incubus of a woman, to whom he transmits the man's\n\nsemen). It is true that the relations between alliance and filiation come to\n\nbe regulated by laws of marriage, but even then alliance retains a danger-\n\nous and contagious power. Leach was able to demonstrate that despite all\n\nthe exceptions that seemingly disprove the rule, the sorcerer belongs first\n\nof all to a group united to the group over which he or she exercises influ-\n\nence only by alliance: thus in a matrilineal group we look to the father's\n\nside for the sorcerer or witch. And there is an entire evolution of sorcery\n\ndepending on whether the relation of alliance acquires permanence or\n\nassumes political weight.\n\n17\n\nIn order to produce werewolves in your own\n\nfamily it is not enough to resemble a wolf, or to live like a wolf: the pact\n\nwith the Devil must be coupled with an alliance with another family, and\n\nit is the return of this alliance to the first family, the reaction of this\nalli-\n\nance on the first family, that produces werewolves by feedback effect. A\n\nfine tale by Erckmann and Chatrian, _Hugues-le-loup, _assembles the tradi-\n\ntions concerning this complex situation.\n\n18\n\nThe contradiction between the two themes, \"contagion through the ani-\n\nmal as pack,\" and \"pact with the anomalous as exceptional being,\" is pro-\n\ngressively fading.

Kachin witchcraft is contagious rather than heredi-\n\ntary ... it is associated with affinity, not filiation.\"\n\n19\n\nAlliance or the pact is\n\nthe form of expression for an infection or epidemic constituting the form of\n\ncontent. In sorcery, blood is of the order of contagion and alliance. It can\nbe\n\nsaid that becoming-animal is an affair of sorcery because (1) it implies an\n\ninitial relation of alliance with a demon; (2) the demon functions as the\n\nborderline of an animal pack, into which the human being passes or in\n\nwhich his or her becoming takes place, by contagion; (3) this becoming\n\nitself implies a second alliance, with another human group; (4) this new\n\nborderline between the two groups guides the contagion of animal and\n\nhuman being within the pack. There is an entire politics of\n\nbecomings-animal, as well as a politics of sorcery, which is elaborated in\n\nassemblages that are neither those of the family nor of religion nor of the\n\nState. Instead, they express minoritarian groups, or groups that are\n\noppressed, prohibited, in revolt, or always on the fringe of recognized\n\ninstitutions, groups all the more secret for being extrinsic, in other words,\n\nanomic. If becoming-animal takes the form of a Temptation, and of\n\nmonsters aroused in the imagination by the demon, it is because it is\n\naccompanied, at its origin as in its undertaking, by a rupture with the\n\ncentral institutions that have established themselves or seek to become\n\nestablished.\n\nLet us cite pell-mell, not as mixes to be made, but as different cases to be\n\nstudied: becomings-animal in the war machine, wildmen of all kinds (the\n\nwar machine indeed comes from without, it is extrinsic to the State, which\n\ntreats the warrior as an anomalous power); becomings-animal in crime\n\nsocieties, leopard-men, crocodile-men (when the State prohibits tribal and\n\nlocal wars); becomings-animal in riot groups (when the Church and State\n\nare faced with peasant movements containing a sorcery component, which\n\nthey repress by setting up a whole trial and legal system designed to expose\n\npacts with the Devil); becomings-animal in asceticism groups, the grazing\n\nanchorite or wild-beast anchorite (the asceticism machine is in an anoma-\n\nlous position, on a line of flight, off to the side of the Church, and\ndisputes\n\nthe Church's pretension to set itself up as an imperial institution);\n\n20\n\nbecomings-animal in societies practicing sexual initiation of the \"sacred\n\ndeflowerer\" type, wolf-men, goat-men, etc. (who claim an Alliance supe-\n\nrior and exterior to the order of families; families have to win from them\n\nthe right to regulate their own alliances, to determine them according to\n\nrelations of complementary lines of descent, and to domesticate this unbri-\n\ndled power of alliance).\n\n21\n\nThe politics of becomings-animal remains, of course, extremely ambig-\n\nuous.

We have seen\n\nsorcerers serve as leaders, rally to the cause of despotism, create the\n\ncountersorcery of exorcism, pass over to the side of the family and descent.\n\nBut this spells the death of the sorcerer, and also the death of becoming. We\n\nhave seen becoming spawn nothing more than a big domestic dog, as in\n\nHenry Miller's damnation (\"it would be better to feign, to pretend to be an\n\nanimal, a dog for example, and catch the bone thrown to me from time to\n\ntime\") or Fitzgerald's (\"I will try to be a correct animal though, and if you\n\nthrow me a bone with enough meat on it I may even lick your hand\").

D 249\n\nbooks clearly illustrate this evolution, or rather this involution, in which\n\nthe affects of a becoming-dog, for example, are succeeded by those of a\n\nbecoming-molecular, microperceptions of water, air, etc. A man totters\n\nfrom one door to the next and disappears into thin air: \"All I can tell you is\n\nthat we are fluid, luminous beings made of fibers.\"\n\n24\n\nAll so-called initiatory\n\njourneys include these thresholds and doors where becoming itself\n\nbecomes, and where one changes becoming depending on the \"hour\" of the\n\nworld, the circles of hell, or the stages of a journey that sets scales,\nforms,\n\nand cries in variation. From the howling of animals to the wailing of ele-\n\nments and particles.\n\nThus packs, or multiplicities, continually transform themselves into\n\neach other, cross over into each other. Werewolves become vampires when\n\nthey die. This is not surprising, since becoming and multiplicity are the\n\nsame thing. A multiplicity is defined not by its elements, nor by a center of\n\nunification or comprehension. It is defined by the number of dimensions it\n\nhas; it is not divisible, it cannot lose or gain a dimension _without changing  \nits nature. _Since its variations and dimensions are immanent to it, _it  \namounts to the same thing to say that each multiplicity is already composed  \nof heterogeneous terms in symbiosis, and that a multiplicity is continually  \ntransforming itself into a string of other multiplicities, according to its  \nthresholds and doors. _For example, the Wolf-Man's pack of wolves also\n\nbecomes a swarm of bees, and a field of anuses, and a collection of small\n\nholes and tiny ulcerations (the theme of contagion): all these heterogene-\n\nous elements compose \"the\" multiplicity of symbiosis and becoming. If we\n\nimagined the position of a fascinated Self, it was because the multiplicity\n\ntoward which it leans, stretching to the breaking point, is the continuation\n\nof another multiplicity that works it and strains it from the inside. In fact,\n\nthe self is only a threshold, a door, a becoming between two multiplicities.\n\nEach multiplicity is defined by a borderline functioning as Anomalous, but\n\nthere is a string of borderlines, a continuous line of borderlines _(fiber)\n_fol-\n\nlowing which the multiplicity changes. And at each threshold or door, a\n\nnew pact? A fiber stretches from a human to an animal, from a human or an\n\nanimal to molecules, from molecules to particles, and so on to the imper-\n\nceptible. Every fiber is a Universe fiber. A fiber strung across borderlines\n\nconstitutes a line of flight or of deterritorialization. It is evident that\nthe\n\nAnomalous, the Outsider, has several functions: not only does it border\n\neach multiplicity, of which it determines the temporary or local stability\n\n(with the highest number of dimensions possible under the circum-\n\nstances), not only is it the precondition for the alliance necessary to becom-\n\ning, but it also carries the transformations of becoming or crossings of\n\nmultiplicities always farther down the line of flight. Moby-Dick is the  \n_White Wall _bordering the pack; he is also the demonic _Term of the\nAlliance;_\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)272.png)\n\n0\n\n250 O\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...\n\nfinally, he is the terrible _Fishing Line _with nothing on the other end, the\nline\n\nthat crosses the wall and drags the captain .. . where? Into the void . . .\n\nThe error we must guard against is to believe that there is a kind of logi-\n\ncal order to this string, these crossings or transformations. It is already\n\ngoing too far to postulate an order descending from the animal to the vege-\n\ntable, then to molecules, to particles. Each multiplicity is symbiotic; its\n\nbecoming ties together animals, plants, microorganisms, mad particles, a\n\nwhole galaxy. Nor is there a preformed logical order to these heterogenei-\n\nties, the Wolf-Man's wolves, bees, anuses, little scars. Of course, sorcery\n\nalways codifies certain transformations of becomings. Take a novel\n\nsteeped in the traditions of sorcery, Alexandre Dumas's _Menem de loups; _\n\nin a first pact, the man of the fringes gets the Devil to agree to make his\n\nwishes come true, with the stipulation that a lock of his hair turn red each\n\ntime he gets a wish. We are in the hair-multiplicity, hair is the borderline.\n\nThe man himself takes a position on the wolves' borderline, as leader of the\n\npack. Then when he no longer has a single human hair left, a second pact\n\nmakes him become-wolf himself; it is an endless becoming since he is only\n\nvulnerable one day in the year. We are aware that between the\n\nhair-multiplicity and the wolf-multiplicity it is always possible to induce\n\nan order of resemblance (red like the fur of a wolf); but the resemblance\n\nremains quite secondary (the wolf of the transformation is black, with one\n\nwhite hair). In fact, there is a first multiplicity, of hair, taken up in a\n\nbecoming-red fur; and a second multiplicity, of wolves, which in turn takes\n\nup the becoming-animal of the man. Between the two, there is threshold\n\nand fiber, symbiosis of or passage between heterogeneities. That is how we\n\nsorcerers operate. Not following a logical order, but following alogical con-\n\nsistencies or compatibilities. The reason is simple. It is because no one, not\n\neven God, can say in advance whether two borderlines will string together\n\nor form a fiber, whether a given multiplicity will or will not cross over into\n\nanother given multiplicity, or even if given heterogeneous elements will\n\nenter symbiosis, will form a consistent, or cofunctioning, multiplicity sus-\n\nceptible to transformation. No one can say where the line of flight will pass:\n\nWill it let itself get bogged down and fall back to the Oedipal family animal,\n\na mere poodle? Or will it succumb to another danger, for example, turning\n\ninto a line of abolition, annihilation, self-destruction, Ahab,Ahab... ?We\n\nare all too familiar with the dangers of the line of flight, and with its\nambi-\n\nguities. The risks are ever-present, but it is always possible to have the\ngood\n\nfortune of avoiding them. Case by case, we can tell whether the line is con-\n\nsistent, in other words, whether the heterogeneities effectively function in\n\na multiplicity of symbiosis, whether the multiplicities are effectively trans-\n\nformed through the becomings of passage. Let us take an example as simple\n\nas: _x _starts practicing piano again.

Is it a new borderline, an\n\nactive line that will bring other becomings entirely different from becom-\n\ning or rebecoming a pianist, that will induce a transformation of all of the\n\npreceding assemblages to which _x _was prisoner? Is it a way out? Is it a pact\n\nwith the Devil? Schizoanalysis, or pragmatics, has no other meaning: Make\n\na rhizome. But you don't know what you can make a rhizome with, you\n\ndon't know which subterranean stem is effectively going to make a rhi-\n\nzome, or enter a becoming, people your desert. So experiment.\n\nThat's easy to say? Although there is no preformed logical order to\n\nbecomings and multiplicities, there are _criteria, _and the important thing is\n\nthat they not be used after the fact, that they be applied in the course of\n\nevents, that they be sufficient to guide us through the dangers. If\nmultiplici-\n\nties are defined and transformed by the borderline that determines in each\n\ninstance their number of dimensions, we can conceive of the possibility of\n\nlaying them out on a plane, the borderlines succeeding one another, form-\n\ning a broken line. It is only in appearance that a plane of this kind\n\"reduces\"\n\nthe number of dimensions; for it gathers in all the dimensions to the extent\n\nthat _flat multiplicities_\u2014which nonetheless have _an increasing or decreas-  \ning number of dimensions_\u2014are inscribed upon it. It is in grandiose and\n\nsimplified terms that Lovecraft attempted to pronounce sorcery's final\n\nword: \"Then the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his\n\nunderstanding, reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his pres-\n\nent fragment was an infinitesimal part. They told him that every figure of\n\nspace is but the result of the intersection by a plane of some corresponding\n\nfigure of one more dimension\u2014as a square is cut from a cube, or a circle\n\nfrom a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three dimensions, are thus cut from\n\ncorresponding forms of four dimensions, which men know only through\n\nguesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimen-\n\nsions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infin-\n\nity.\"\n\n25\n\nFar from reducing the multiplicities' number of dimensions to two,\n\nthe _plane of consistency _cuts across them all, intersects them in order to\n\nbring into coexistence any number of multiplicities, with any number of\n\ndimensions. The plane of consistency is the intersection of all concrete\n\nforms. Therefore all becomings are written like sorcerers' drawings on this\n\nplane of consistency, which is the ultimate Door providing a way out for\n\nthem. This is the only criterion to prevent them from bogging down, or\n\nveering into the void. The only question is: Does a given becoming reach\n\nthat point? Can a given multiplicity flatten and conserve all its dimensions\n\nin this way, like a pressed flower that remains just as alive dry? Lawrence,\nin\n\nhis becoming-tortoise, moves from the most obstinate animal dynamism\n\nto the abstract, pure geometry of scales and \"cleavages of division,\" with-\n\nout, however, losing any of the dynamism: he pushes becoming-tortoise all\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)274.png)\n\n0\n\n252 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL .. .\n\nthe way to the plane of consistency.\n\n26\n\nEverything becomes imperceptible,\n\neverything is becoming-imperceptible on the plane of consistency, which is\n\nnevertheless precisely where the imperceptible is seen and heard. It is the\n\nPlanomenon, or the Rhizosphere, the Criterium (and still other names, as\n\nthe number of dimensions increases). At _n _dimensions, it is called the\n\nHypersphere, the Mechanosphere. It is the abstract Figure, or rather, since\n\nit has no form itself, the abstract Machine of which each concrete assem-\n\nblage is a multiplicity, a becoming, a segment, a vibration. And the abstract\n\nmachine is the intersection of them all.\n\nWaves are vibrations, shifting borderlines inscribed on the plane of con-\n\nsistency as so many abstractions. The abstract machine of the waves. In  \n_The Waves, _Virginia Woolf\u2014who made all of her life and work a passage, a\n\nbecoming, all kinds of becomings between ages, sexes, elements, and king-\n\ndoms\u2014intermingles seven characters, Bernard, Neville, Louis, Jinny,\n\nRhoda, Suzanne, and Percival. But each of these characters, with his or her\n\nname, its individuality, designates a multiplicity (for example, Bernard\n\nand the school offish). Each is simultaneously in this multiplicity and at its\n\nedge, and crosses over into the others. Percival is like the ultimate\nmultipli-\n\ncity enveloping the greatest number of dimensions. But he is not yet the\n\nplane of consistency. Although Rhoda thinks she sees him rising out of the\n\nsea, no, it is not he. \"When the white arm rests upon the knee it is a\ntriangle;\n\nnow it is upright\u2014a column; now a fountain.. .. Behind it roars the sea. It\n\nis beyond our reach.\"\n\n27\n\nEach advances like a wave, but on the plane of con-\n\nsistency they are a single abstract Wave whose vibration propagates follow-\n\ning a line of flight or deterritorialization traversing the entire plane (each\n\nchapter of Woolf s novel is preceded by a meditation on an aspect of the\n\nwaves, on one of their hours, on one of their becomings).\n\n_**Memories of a Theologian. **_Theology is very strict on the following\npoint:\n\nthere are no werewolves, human beings cannot become animal. That is\n\nbecause there is no transformation of essential forms; they are inalienable\n\nand only entertain relations of analogy. The Devil and the witch, and the\n\npact between them, are no less real for that, for there is in reality a _local  \nmovement _that is properly diabolical. Theology distinguishes two cases,\n\nused as models during the Inquisition: that of Ulysses' companions, and\n\nthat of Diomedes' companions, the imaginary vision and the spell. In the\n\nfirst, the subject believes him- or herself to be transformed into an animal,\n\npig, ox, or wolf, and the observers believe it too; but this is an internal\nlocal\n\nmovement bringing sensible images back to the imagination and bouncing\n\nthem off external meanings. In the second, the Devil \"assumes\" real ani-\n\nmal bodies, even transporting the accidents and affects befalling them to\n\nother bodies (for example, a cat or a wolf that has been taken over by the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)275.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 253\n\nDevil can receive wounds that are relayed to an exactly corresponding part\n\nof a human body).\n\n28\n\nThis is a way of saying that the human being does not\n\nbecome animal in reality, but that there is nevertheless a demonic reality of\n\nthe becoming-animal of the human being. Therefore it is certain that the\n\ndemon performs local transports of all kinds. The Devil is a transporter; he\n\ntransports humors, affects, or even bodies (the Inquisition brooks no com-\n\npromises on this power of the Devil: the witch's broom, or \"the Devil take\n\nyou\"). But these transports cross neither the barrier of essential forms nor\n\nthat of substances or subjects.\n\nThere is another, altogether different, problem concerning the laws of\n\nnature that has to do not with demonology but with alchemy, and above all\n\nphysics. It is the problem of accidental forms, distinct from both essential\n\nforms and determined subjects. For accidental forms are susceptible to  \n_more and less: _more or less charitable, but also more or less white, more or\n\nless warm. A degree of heat is a perfectly individuated warmth distinct\n\nfrom the substance or the subject that receives it. A degree of heat can enter\n\ninto composition with a degree of whiteness, or with another degree of\n\nheat, to form a third unique individuality distinct from that of the subject.\n\nWhat is the individuality of a day, a season, an event? A shorter day and a\n\nlonger day are not, strictly speaking, extensions but degrees proper to\n\nextension, just as there are degrees proper to heat, color, etc. An accidental\n\nform therefore has a \"latitude\" constituted by a certain number of\n\ncomposable individuations. A degree, an intensity, is an individual, a  \n_Haecceity _that enters into composition with other degrees, other intensi-\n\nties, to form another individual. Can latitude be explained by the fact that\n\nthe subject participates more or less in the accidental form? But do these\n\ndegrees of participation not imply a flutter, a vibration in the form itself\n\nthat is not reducible to the properties of a subject? Moreover, if intensities\n\nof heat are not composed by addition, it is because one must add their\n\nrespective subjects; it is the subjects that prevent the heat of the whole\nfrom\n\nincreasing. All the more reason to effect distributions of intensity, to\nestab-\n\nlish latitudes that are \"deformedly deformed,\" speeds, slownesses, and\n\ndegrees of all kinds corresponding to a body or set of bodies taken as longi-\n\ntude: a cartography.\n\n29\n\nIn short, between substantial forms and determined\n\nsubjects, _between the two, _there is not only a whole operation of demonic\n\nlocal transports but a natural play of haecceities, degrees, intensities,\n\nevents, and accidents that compose individuations totally different from\n\nthose of the well-formed subjects that receive them.\n\n_**Memories of a Spinozist, I. **_Substantial or essential forms have been\ncri-\n\ntiqued in many different ways. Spinoza's approach is radical: Arrive at ele-\n\nments that no longer have either form or function, that are abstract in this\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)276.png)\n\n0\n\n254 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nsense even though they are perfectly real. They are distinguished solely by\n\nmovement and rest, slowness and speed. They are not atoms, in other\n\nwords, finite elements still endowed with form. Nor are they indefinitely\n\ndivisible. They are infinitely small, ultimate parts of an actual infinity,\nlaid\n\nout on the same plane of consistency or composition. They are not defined\n\nby their number since they always come in infinities. However, depending\n\non their degree of speed or the relation of movement and rest into which\n\nthey enter, they belong to a given Individual, which may itself be part of\n\nanother Individual governed by another, more complex, relation, and so\n\non to infinity. There are thus smaller and larger infinities, not by virtue of\n\ntheir number, but by virtue of the composition of the relation into which\n\ntheir parts enter. Thus each individual is an infinite multiplicity, and the\n\nwhole of Nature is a multiplicity of perfectly individuated multiplicities.\n\nThe plane of consistency of Nature is like an immense Abstract Machine,\n\nabstract yet real and individual; its pieces are the various assemblages and\n\nindividuals, each of which groups together an infinity of particles entering\n\ninto an infinity of more or less interconnected relations. There is therefore\n\na unity to the plane of nature, which applies equally to the inanimate and\n\nthe animate, the artificial and the natural. This plane has nothing to do\n\nwith a form or a figure, nor with a design or a function. Its unity has\nnothing\n\nto do with a ground buried deep within things, nor with an end or a project\n\nin the mind of God. Instead, it is a plane upon which everything is laid out,\n\nand which is like the intersection of all forms, the machine of all functions;\n\nits dimensions, however, increase with those of the multiplicities of indi-\n\nvidualities it cuts across. It is a fixed plane, upon which things are dis-\n\ntinguished from one another only by speed and slowness. A plane of\n\nimmanence or univocality opposed to analogy. The One is said with a single\n\nmeaning of all the multiple. Being expresses in a single meaning all that\n\ndiffers. What we are talking about is not the unity of substance but the\ninfinity\n\nof the modifications that are part of one another on this unique plane of\nlife.\n\nThe never-ending debate between Cuvier and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire:\n\nboth agree at least in denouncing resemblances, or imaginary, sensible\n\nanalogies, but in Cuvier, scientific definition concerns the relations\n\nbetween organs, and between organs and functions. Cuvier thus takes anal-\n\nogy to the scientific stage, making it an analogy of proportionality. The\n\nunity of the plane, according to him, can only be a unity of analogy, there-\n\nfore a transcendent unity that cannot be realized without fragmenting into\n\ndistinct branches, according to irreducible, uncrossable, heterogeneous\n\ncompositions. Baer would later add: according to noncommunicating\n\ntypes of development and differentiation. The plane is a hidden plan(e) of\n\norganization, a structure or genesis.

Speed and slow-\n\nness, movement and rest, tardiness and rapidity subordinate not only the\n\nforms of structure but also the types of development. This approach later\n\nreappears in an evolutionist framework, with Perrier's tachygenesis and\n\ndifferential rates of growth in allometry: species as kinematic entities that\n\nare either precocious or retarded. (Even the question of fertility is less one\n\nof form and function than speed; do the paternal chromosomes arrive early\n\nenough to be incorporated into the nuclei?) In any case, there is a pure\n\nplane of immanence, univocality, composition, upon which everything is\n\ngiven, upon which unformed elements and materials dance that are distin-\n\nguished from one another only by their speed and that enter into this or\n\nthat individuated assemblage depending on their connections, their rela-\n\ntions of movement. A fixed plane of life upon which everything stirs, slows\n\ndown or accelerates. A single abstract Animal for all the assemblages that\n\neffectuate it. A unique plane of consistency or composition for the\n\ncephalo-pod and the vertebrate; for the vertebrate to become an Octopus or\n\nCuttlefish, all it would have to do is fold itself in two fast enough to fuse\n\nthe elements of the halves of its back together, then bring its pelvis up to\n\nthe nape of its neck and gather its limbs together into one of its\nextremities,\n\nlike \"a clown who throws his head and shoulders back and walks on his\n\nhead and hands.\"\n\n30\n\n_Plication. _It is no longer a question of organs and\n\nfunctions, and of a transcendent Plane that can preside over their\n\norganization only by means of analogical relations and types of divergent\n\ndevelopment. It is a question not of organization but of composition; not\n\nof development or differentiation but of movement and rest, speed and\n\nslowness. It is a question of elements and particles, which do or do not\n\narrive fast enough to effect a passage, a becoming or jump on the same\n\nplane of pure immanence. And if there are in fact jumps, rifts between\n\nassemblages, it is not by virtue of their essential irreducibility but rather\n\nbecause there are always elements that do not arrive on time, or arrive\n\nafter everything is over; thus it is necessary to pass through fog, to cross\n\nvoids, to have lead times and delays, which are themselves part of the\n\nplane of immanence. Even the failures are part of the plane. We must try to\n\nconceive of this world in which a single fixed plane\u2014which we shall call a\n\nplane of absolute immobility _or _absolute movement\u2014is traversed by\n\nnonformal elements of relative speed that enter this or that individuated\n\nassemblage depending on their degrees of speed and slowness.

When Little Hans talks about a\n\n\"peepee-maker,\" he is referring not to an organ or an organic function but\n\nbasically to a material, in other words, to an aggregate whose elements\n\nvary according to its connections, its relations of movement and rest, the\n\ndifferent individuated assemblages it enters. Does a girl have a\n\npeepee-maker? The boy says yes, and not by analogy, nor in order to\n\nconjure away a fear of castration. It is obvious that girls have a\n\npeepee-maker because they effectively pee: a machinic functioning rather\n\nthan an organic function. Quite simply, the same material has different\n\nconnections, different relations of movement and rest, enters different\n\nassemblages in the case of the boy and the girl (a girl does not pee standing\n\nor into the distance). Does a locomotive have a peepee-maker? Yes, in yet\n\nanother machinic assemblage. Chairs don't have them: but that is because\n\nthe elements of the chair were not able to integrate this material into their\n\nrelations, or decomposed the relation with that material to the point that it\n\nyielded something else, a rung, for example. It has been noted that for\n\nchildren an organ has \"a thousand vicissitudes,\" that it is \"difficult to\n\nlocalize, difficult to identify, it is in turn a bone, an engine, excrement,\nthe\n\nbaby, a hand, daddy's heart...\" This is not at all because the organ is\n\nexperienced as a part-object. It is because the organ is exactly what its\n\nelements make it according to their relation of movement or rest, and the\n\nway in which this relation combines with or splits off from that of\n\nneighboring elements. This is not animism, any more than it is mechanism;\n\nrather, it is universal machinism: a plane of consistency occupied by an\n\nimmense abstract machine comprising an infinite number of assemblages.\n\nChildren's questions are poorly understood if they are not seen as\n\nquestion-machines; that is why indefinite articles play so important a role\n\nin these questions _(a _belly, a child, a horse, a chair, \"how is _a _person\n\nmade?\"). Spinozism is the becoming-child of the philosopher. We call the  \n_longitude _of a body the particle aggregates belonging to that body in a\ngiven\n\nrelation; these aggregates are part of each other depending on the\n\ncomposition of the relation that defines the individuated assemblage of\n\nthe body.\n\n_**Memories of a Spinozist, II. **_There is another aspect to Spinoza. To\nevery\n\nrelation of movement and rest, speed and slowness grouping together an\n\ninfinity of parts, there corresponds a degree of power. To the relations com-\n\nposing, decomposing, or modifying an individual there correspond inten-\n\nsities that affect it, augmenting or diminishing its power to act; these\n\nintensities come from external parts or from the individual's own parts.\n\nAffects are becomings. Spinoza asks: What can a body do? We call the _lati-  \ntude _of a body the affects of which it is capable at a given degree of power,\nor\n\nrather within the limits of that degree. _Latitude is made up of intensive\nparts_\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)279.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...

This kind of study is called\n\nethology, and this is the sense in which Spinoza wrote a true Ethics. A race-\n\nhorse is more different from a workhorse than a workhorse is from an ox.\n\nVon Uexkull, in defining animal worlds, looks for the active and passive\n\naffects of which the animal is capable in the individuated assemblage of\n\nwhich it is a part. For example, the Tick, attracted by the light, hoists\nitself\n\nup to the tip of a branch; it is sensitive to the smell of mammals, and lets\n\nitself fall when one passes beneath the branch; it digs into its skin, at the\n\nleast hairy place it can find. Just three affects; the rest of the time the\ntick\n\nsleeps, sometimes for years on end, indifferent to all that goes on in the\n\nimmense forest. Its degree of power is indeed bounded by two limits: the\n\noptimal limit of the feast after which it dies, and the pessimal limit of the\n\nfast as it waits. It will be said that the tick's three affects assume generic\nand\n\nspecific characteristics, organs and functions, legs and snout. This is true\n\nfrom the standpoint of physiology, but not from the standpoint of Ethics.\n\nQuite the contrary, in Ethics the organic characteristics derive from longi-\n\ntude and its relations, from latitude and its degrees. We know nothing\n\nabout a body until we know what it can do, in other words, what its affects\n\nare, how they can or cannot enter into composition with other affects, with\n\nthe affects of another body, either to destroy that body or to be destroyed by\n\nit, either to exchange actions and passions with it or to join with it in com-\n\nposing a more powerful body.\n\nOnce again, we turn to children. Note how they talk about animals, and\n\nare moved by them. They make a list of affects. Little Hans's horse is not\n\nrepresentative but affective. It is not a member of a species but an element\n\nor individual in a machinic assemblage: draft horse-omnibus-street. It is\n\ndefined by a list of active and passive affects in the context of the\n\nindividuated assemblage it is part of: having eyes blocked by blinders, hav-\n\ning a bit and a bridle, being proud, having a big peepee-maker, pulling\n\nheavy loads, being whipped, falling, making a din with its legs, biting, etc.\n\nThese affects circulate and are transformed within the assemblage: what a\n\nhorse \"can do.\" They indeed have an optimal limit at the summit of horse-\n\npower, but also a pessimal threshold: a horse falls down in the street! It\ncan't\n\nget back on its feet with that heavy load on its back, and the excessive whip-\n\nping; a horse is going to die!\u2014this was an ordinary sight in those days\n\n(Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Nijinsky lamented it). So just what is the\n\nbecoming-horse of Little Hans? Hans is also taken up in an assemblage: his\n\nmother's bed, the paternal element, the house, the cafe across the street, the\n\nnearby warehouse, the street, the right to go out onto the street, the winning\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)280.png)\n\n0\n\n258 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nof this right, the pride of winning it, but also the dangers of winning it,\nthe\n\nfall, shame .. . These are not phantasies or subjective reveries: it is not a\n\nquestion of imitating a horse, \"playing\" horse, identifying with one, or\n\neven experiencing feelings of pity or sympathy. Neither does it have to do\n\nwith an objective analogy between assemblages. The question is whether\n\nLittle Hans can endow his own elements with the relations of movement\n\nand rest, the affects, that would make it become horse, forms and subjects\n\naside. Is there an as yet unknown assemblage that would be neither Hans's\n\nnor the horse's, but that of the becoming-horse of Hans? An assemblage,\n\nfor example, in which the horse would bare its teeth and Hans might show\n\nsomething else, his feet, his legs, his peepee-maker, whatever? And in what\n\nway would that ameliorate Hans's problem, to what extent would it open a\n\nway out that had been previously blocked? When Hofmannsthal contem-\n\nplates the death throes of a rat, it is in him that the animal \"bares his\nteeth at\n\nmonstrous fate.\" _This is not a feeling of pity, _as he makes clear; still\nless an\n\nidentification. It is a composition of speeds and affects involving entirely\n\ndifferent individuals, a symbiosis; it makes the rat become a thought, a\n\nfeverish thought in the man, at the same time as the man becomes a rat\n\ngnashing its teeth in its death throes. The rat and the man are in no way the\n\nsame thing, but Being expresses them both in a single meaning in a lan-\n\nguage that is no longer that of words, in a matter that is no longer that of\n\nforms, in an affectability that is no longer that of subjects. _Unnatural par-  \nticipation. _But the plane of composition, the plane of Nature, is precisely\n\nfor participations of this kind, and continually makes and unmakes their\n\nassemblages, employing every artifice.\n\nThis is not an analogy, or a product of the imagination, but a composi-\n\ntion of speeds and affects on the plane of consistency: a plan(e), a program,\n\nor rather a diagram, a problem, a question-machine. Vladimir Slepian for-\n\nmulates the \"problem\" in a thoroughly curious text: I'm hungry, always\n\nhungry, a man should not be hungry, so I'll have to become a dog\u2014but\n\nhow? This will not involve imitating a dog, nor an analogy of relations. I\n\nmust succeed in endowing the parts of my body with relations of speed and\n\nslowness that will make it become dog, in an original assemblage proceed-\n\ning neither by resemblance nor by analogy. For I cannot become dog with-\n\nout the dog itself becoming something else. Slepian gets the idea of using\n\nshoes to solve this problem, the artifice of the shoes. If I wear shoes on my\n\nhands, then their elements will enter into a new relation, resulting in the\n\naffect or becoming I seek. But how will I be able to tie the shoe on my sec-\n\nond hand, once the first is already occupied? With my mouth, which in\n\nturn receives an investment in the assemblage, becoming a dog muzzle,\n\ninsofar as a dog muzzle is now used to tie shoes. At each stage of the prob-\n\nlem, what needs to be done is not to compare two organs but to place ele-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)281.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 259\n\nments or materials in a relation that uproots the organ from its specificity,\n\nmaking it become \"with\" the other organ. But this becoming, which has\n\nalready taken in feet, hands, and mouth, will nevertheless fail. It founders\n\non the tail. The tail would have had to have been invested, forced to exhibit\n\nelements common to the sexual organ and the caudal appendage, so that\n\nthe former would be taken up in the becoming-dog of the man at the same\n\ntime as the latter were taken up in a becoming of the dog, in another becom-\n\ning that would also be part of the assemblage. The plan(e) fails, Slepian fal-\n\nters on this point. The tail remains an organ of the man on the one hand and\n\nan appendage of the dog on the other; their relations do not enter into com-\n\nposition in the new assemblage. This is where psychoanalytic drift sets in,\n\nbringing back all the cliches about the tail, the mother, the childhood mem-\n\nory of the mother threading needles, all those concrete figures and sym-\n\nbolic analogies.\n\n31\n\nBut this is the way Slepian wants it in this fine text. For\n\nthere is a way in which the failure of the plan(e) is part of the plan(e)\nitself:\n\nThe plan(e) is infinite, you can start it in a thousand different ways; you\nwill\n\nalways find something that comes too late or too early, forcing you to\n\nrecompose all of your relations of speed and slowness, all of your affects,\n\nand to rearrange the overall assemblage. An infinite undertaking. But there\n\nis another way in which the plan(e) fails; this time, it is because _another  \nplan(e) _returns full force, breaking the becoming-animal, folding the ani-\n\nmal back onto the animal and the person onto the person, recognizing only\n\nresemblances between elements and analogies between relations. Slepian\n\nconfronts both dangers.\n\nWe wish to make a simple point about psychoanalysis: from the begin-\n\nning, it has often encountered the question of the becomings-animal of the\n\nhuman being: in children, who continually undergo becomings of this\n\nkind; in fetishism and in particular masochism, which continually con-\n\nfront this problem. The least that can be said is that the psychoanalysts,\n\neven Jung, did not understand, or did not want to understand. They killed\n\nbecoming-animal, in the adult as in the child. They saw nothing. They see\n\nthe animal as a representative of drives, or a representation of the parents.\n\nThey do not see the reality of a becoming-animal, that it is affect in itself,\n\nthe drive in person, and represents nothing. There exist no other drives\n\nthan the assemblages themselves. There are two classic texts in which\n\nFreud sees nothing but the father in the becoming-horse of Hans, and\n\nFerenczi sees the same in the becoming-cock of Arpad. The horse's blind-\n\ners are the father's eyeglasses, the black around its mouth is his mustache,\n\nits kicks are the parents' \"lovemaking.\" Not one word about Hans's rela-\n\ntion to the street, on how the street was forbidden to him, on what it is for\na\n\nchild to see the spectacle \"a horse is proud, a blinded horse pulls, a horse\n\nfalls, a horse is whipped...\" Psychoanalysis has no feeling for unnatural\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)282.png)\n\n0\n\n260 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL. ..\n\nparticipations, nor for the assemblages a child can mount in order to solve  \na problem from which all exits are barred him: a _plan(e), _not a phantasy.  \nSimilarly, fewer stupidities would be uttered on the topic of pain, humilia-  \ntion, and anxiety in masochism if it were understood that it is the  \nbecomings-animal that lead the masochism, not the other way around.  \nThere are always apparatuses, tools, engines involved, there are always  \nartifices and constraints used in taking Nature to the fullest. That is  \nbecause it is necessary to annul the organs, to shut them away so that their  \nliberated elements can enter into the new relations from which the  \nbecoming-animal, and the circulation of affects within the machinic  \nassemblage, will result. As we have seen elsewhere, this was the case for the  \nmask, the bridle, the bit, and the penis sheath in _Equus eroticus: _paradoxi-  \ncally, in the becoming-horse assemblage the man subdues his own \"instinc-  \ntive\" forces while the animal transmits to him its \"acquired\" forces.  \nReversal, unnatural participation. And the boots of the woman-master  \nfunction to annul the leg as a human organ, to make the elements of the leg  \nenter a relation suited to the overall assemblage: \"In this way, it will no  \nlonger be women's legs that have an effect on me . . ,\"\n\n32\n\nBut to break the\n\nbecoming-animal all that is needed is to extract a segment from it, to  \nabstract one of its moments, to fail to take into account its internal speeds  \nand slownesses, to arrest the circulation of affects. Then nothing remains  \nbut imaginary resemblances between terms, or symbolic analogies  \nbetween relations. This segment refers to the father, that relation of move-  \nment and rest refers to the primal scene, etc. It must be recognized that psy-  \nchoanalysis alone is not enough to bring about this breakage. It only brings  \nout a danger inherent in becoming. There is always the danger of finding  \nyourself \"playing\" the animal, the domestic Oedipal animal, Miller going  \nbowwow and taking a bone, Fitzgerald licking your hand, Slepian returning  \nto his mother, or the old man playing horse or dog on an erotic postcard  \nfrom 1900 (and \"playing\" at being a wild animal would be no better).  \nBecomings-animal continually run these dangers.\n\n_Memories of a Haecceity. _A body is not defined by the form that deter-\n\nmines it nor as a determinate substance or subject nor by the organs it pos-\n\nsesses or the functions it fulfills. On the plane of consistency, _a body is  \ndefined only by a longitude and a latitude: _in other words the sum total of\n\nthe material elements belonging to it under given relations of movement\n\nand rest, speed and slowness (longitude); the sum total of the intensive\n\naffects it is capable of at a given power or degree of potential (latitude).\n\nNothing but affects and local movements, differential speeds. The credit\n\ngoes to Spinoza for calling attention to these two dimensions of the Body,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)283.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 261\n\nand for having defined the plane of Nature as pure longitude and latitude.\n\nLatitude and longitude are the two elements of a cartography.\n\nThere is a mode of individuation very different from that of a person,\n\nsubject, thing, or substance. We reserve the name _haecceity _for it.\n\n33\n\nA sea-\n\nson, a winter, a summer, an hour, a date have a perfect individuality lacking\n\nnothing, even though this individuality is different from that of a thing or a\n\nsubject. They are haecceities in the sense that they consist entirely of rela-\n\ntions of movement and rest between molecules or particles, capacities to\n\naffect and be affected. When demonology expounds upon the diabolical\n\nart of local movements and transports of affect, it also notes the impor-\n\ntance of rain, hail, wind, pestilential air, or air polluted by noxious parti-\n\ncles, favorable conditions for these transports. Tales must contain\n\nhaecceities that are not simply emplacements, but concrete individuations\n\nthat have a status of their own and direct the metamorphosis of things and\n\nsubjects. Among types of civilizations, the Orient has many more\n\nindividuations by haecceity than by subjectivity or substantiality: the\n\nhaiku, for example, must include indicators as so many floating lines con-\n\nstituting a complex individual. In Charlotte Bronte, everything is in terms\n\nof _wind, _things, people, faces, loves, words. Lorca's \"five in the evening,\"\n\nwhen love falls and fascism rises. That awful five in the evening! We say,\n\n\"What a story!\" \"What heat!\" \"What a life!\" to designate a very singular\n\nindividuation. The hours of the day in Lawrence, in Faulkner. A degree of\n\nheat, an intensity of white, are perfect individualities; and a degree of heat\n\ncan combine in latitude with another degree to form a new individual, as in\n\na body that is cold here and hot there depending on its longitude. Norwe-\n\ngian omelette. A degree of heat can combine with an intensity of white, as\n\nin certain white skies of a hot summer. This is in no way an individuality of\n\nthe instant, as opposed to the individuality of permanences or durations. A\n\ntear-off calendar has just as much time as a perpetual calendar, although\n\nthe time in question is not the same. There are animals that live no longer\n\nthan a day or an hour; conversely, a group of years can be as long as the most\n\ndurable subject or object. We can conceive of an abstract time that is equal\n\nfor haecceities and for subjects or things. Between the extreme slownesses\n\nand vertiginous speeds of geology and astronomy, Michel Tournier places\n\nmeteorology, where meteors live at our pace: \"A cloud forms in the sky like\n\nan image in my brain, the wind blows like I breathe, a rainbow spans the\n\nhorizon for as long as my heart needs to reconcile itself to life, the summer\n\npasses like vacation drifts by.\" But is it by chance that in Tournier's novel\n\nthis certitude can come only to a twin hero who is deformed and\n\ndesubjectified, and has acquired a certain ubiquity?\n\n34\n\nEven when times are\n\nabstractly equal, the individuation of a life is not the same as the\n\nindividuation of the subject that leads it or serves as its support.

And\nit\n\nis not in the same time, the same temporality. _Aeon: _the indefinite time of\n\nthe event, the floating line that knows only speeds and continually divides\n\nthat which transpires into an already-there that is at the same time\n\nnot-yet-here, a simultaneous too-late and too-early, a something that is\n\nboth going to happen and has just happened. _Chronos: _the time of\n\nmeasure that situates things and persons, develops a form, and determines\n\na subject.\n\n35\n\nBoulez distinguishes tempo and nontempo in music: the\n\n\"pulsed time\" of a formal and functional music based on values versus the\n\n\"nonpulsed time\" of a floating music, both floating _and _machinic, which\n\nhas nothing but speeds or differences in dynamic.\n\n36\n\nIn short, the\n\ndifference is not at all between the ephemeral and the durable, nor even\n\nbetween the regular and the irregular, but between two modes of\n\nindividuation, two modes of temporality.\n\nWe must avoid an oversimplified conciliation, as though there were on\n\nthe one hand formed subjects, of the thing or person type, and on the other\n\nhand spatiotemporal coordinates of the haecceity type. For you will yield\n\nnothing to haecceities unless you realize that that is what you are, and that\n\nyou are nothing but that. When the face becomes a haecceity: \"It seemed a\n\ncurious mixture that simply made do with time, weather and these peo-\n\nple.\"\n\n37\n\nYou are longitude and latitude, a set of speeds and slownesses\n\nbetween unformed particles, a set of nonsubjectified affects. You have the\n\nindividuality of a day, a season, a year, _a life _(regardless of its\nduration)\u2014a\n\nclimate, a wind, a fog, a swarm, a pack (regardless of its regularity). Or at\n\nleast you can have it, you can reach it. A cloud of locusts carried in by the\n\nwind at five in the evening; a vampire who goes out at night, a werewolf at\n\nfull moon. It should not be thought that a haecceity consists simply of a\n\ndecor or backdrop that situates subjects, or of appendages that hold things\n\nand people to the ground. It is the entire assemblage in its individuated\n\naggregate that is a haecceity; it is this assemblage that is defined by a\nlongi-\n\ntude and a latitude, by speeds and affects, independently of forms and sub-\n\njects, which belong to another plane. It is the wolf itself, and the horse,\nand\n\nthe child, that cease to be subjects to become events, in assemblages that\n\nare inseparable from an hour, a season, an atmosphere, an air, a life. The\n\nstreet enters into composition with the horse, just as the dying rat enters\n\ninto composition with the air, and the beast and the full moon enter into\n\ncomposition with each other. At most, we may distinguish assemblage\n\nhaecceities (a body considered only as longitude and latitude) and\n\ninterassemblage haecceities, which also mark the potentialities of becom-\n\ning within each assemblage (the milieu of intersection of the longitudes\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)285.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL.. . \u25a1 263\n\nand latitudes). But the two are strictly inseparable. Climate, wind, season,\n\nhour are not of another nature than the things, animals, or people that pop-\n\nulate them, follow them, sleep and awaken within them. This should be\n\nread without a pause: the animal-stalks-at-five-o'clock. The\n\nbecoming-evening, becoming-night of an animal, blood nuptials. Five\n\no'clock is this animal! This animal is this place! \"The thin dog is running\n\nin the road, this dog is the road,\" cries Virginia Woolf. That is how we\n\nneed to feel. Spatiotemporal relations, determinations, are not predicates\n\nof the thing but dimensions of multiplicities. The street is as much a part\n\nof the omnibus-horse assemblage as the Hans assemblage the\n\nbecoming-horse of which it initiates. We are all five o'clock in the evening,\n\nor another hour, or rather two hours simultaneously, the optimal and the\n\npessimal, noon-midnight, but distributed in a variable fashion. The plane\n\nof consistency contains only haecceities, along intersecting lines. Forms\n\nand subjects are not of that world. Virginia Woolf s walk through the\n\ncrowd, among the taxis. Taking a walk is a haecceity; never again will\n\nMrs. Dalloway say to herself, \"I am this, I am that, he is this, he is that.\"\nAnd\n\n\"She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged. She sliced like a\n\nknife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on.... She\n\nalways had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one\n\nday.\"\n\n38\n\nHaecceity, fog, glare. A haecceity has neither beginning nor end,\n\norigin nor destination; it is always in the middle. It is not made of points,\n\nonly of lines. It is a rhizome.\n\nAnd it is not the same language, at least not the same usage of language.\n\nFor if the plane of consistency only has haecceities for content, it also has\n\nits own particular semiotic to serve as expression. A plane of content and a\n\nplane of expression. This semiotic is composed above all of proper names,\n\nverbs in the infinitive and indefinite articles or pronouns. _Indefinite\narticle  \n+ proper name _+ _infinitive verb _constitutes the basic chain of expression,\n\ncorrelative to the least formalized contents, from the standpoint of a\n\nsemiotic that has freed itself from both formal signifiances and personal\n\nsubjectifications. In the first place, the verb in the infinitive is in no way\n\nindeterminate with respect to time; it expresses the floating, nonpulsed\n\ntime proper to Aeon, in other words, the time of the pure event or of becom-\n\ning, which articulates relative speeds and slownesses independently of the\n\nchronometric or chronological values that time assumes in the other\n\nmodes. There is good reason to oppose the infinitive as mode and tense of\n\nbecoming to all of the other modes and tenses, which pertain to Chronos\n\nsince they form pulsations or values of being (the verb \"to be\" is precisely\n\nthe only one that has no infinitive, or rather the infinitive of which is only\n\nan indeterminate, empty expression, taken abstractly to designate the sum\n\ntotal of definite modes and tenses).\n\n39\n\nSecond, the proper name is no way\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)286.png)\n\n264 \u25a1 1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nthe indicator of a subject; thus it seems useless to ask whether its operation\n\nresembles the nomination of a species, according to whether the subject is\n\nconsidered to be of another nature than that of the Form under which it is\n\nclassified, or only the ultimate act of that Form, the limit of classifica-\n\ntion.\n\n40\n\nThe proper name does not indicate a subject; nor does a noun take\n\non the value of a proper name as a function of a form or a species.

It is the military men and meteo-\n\nrologists who hold the secret of proper names, when they give them to a\n\nstrategic operation or a hurricane. The proper name is not the subject of a\n\ntense but the agent of an infinitive. It marks a longitude and a latitude. If\n\nTick, Wolf, Horse, etc., are true proper names, they are so not by virtue of\n\nthe specific and generic denominators that characterize them but of the\n\nspeeds that compose them and the affects that fill them; it is by virtue of\nthe\n\nevent they are in themselves and in the assemblages\u2014the becoming-horse\n\nof Little Hans, the becoming-wolf of the Were [which etymologically\n\nmeans \"man\"\u2014Trans.], the becoming-tick of the Stoic (other proper\n\nnames).\n\nThird, the indefinite article and the indefinite pronoun are no more\n\nindeterminate than the infinitive. Or rather they are lacking a determina-\n\ntion only insofar as they are applied to a form that is itself indeterminate,\n\nor to a determinable subject. On the other hand, they lack nothing when\n\nthey introduce haecceities, events, the individuation of which does not\n\npass into a form and is not effected by a subject. The indefinite then has\n\nmaximum determination: once upon a time; a child is being beaten; a horse\n\nis falling ... Here, the elements in play find their individuation in the\n\nassemblage of which they are a part, independent of the form of their con-\n\ncept and the subjectivity of their person. We have remarked several times\n\nthe extent to which children use the indefinite not as something indetermi-\n\nnate but, on the contrary, as an individuating function within a collectivity.\n\nThat is why we are dumbfounded by the efforts of psychoanalysis, which\n\ndesperately wants there to be something definite hidden behind the indefi-\n\nnite, a possessive, a person. When the child says \"a belly,\" \"a horse,\" \"how\n\ndo _people _grow up?\" _\"someone _is beating _a _child,\" the psychoanalyst\nhears\n\n\"my belly,\" \"the father,\" \"will I grow up to be like daddy?\" The psychoana-\n\nlyst asks: Who is being beaten, and by whom?\n\n41\n\nEven linguistics is not\n\nimmune from the same prejudice, inasmuch as it is inseparable from a\n\npersonology; according to linguistics, in addition to the indefinite -article\n\nand the pronoun, the third-person pronoun also lacks the determination of\n\nsubjectivity that is proper to the first two persons and is supposedly the\n\nnecessary condition for all enunciation.\n\n42\n\nWe believe on the contrary that the third person indefinite,\n\nHE\n\n,\n\nTHEY\n\n,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)287.png)\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

The plane can be a hidden principle, which\n\nmakes visible what is seen and audible what is heard, etc., which at every\n\ninstant causes the given to be given, in this or that state, at this or that\n\nmoment. But the plane itself is not given. It is by nature hidden. It can only\n\nbe inferred, induced, concluded from that to which it gives rise (simultane-\n\nously or successively, synchronically or diachronically). A plane of this\n\nkind is as much a plan(e) of organization as of development: it is structural\n\nor genetic, and both at once, structure and genesis, the structural plan(e) of\n\nformed organizations with their developments, the genetic plan(e) of evo-\n\nlutionary developments with their organizations. These are only nuances\n\nof this first conception of the plane. To accord these nuances too much\n\nimportance would prevent us from grasping something more important;\n\nthat the plan(e), conceived or made in this fashion, always concerns the\n\ndevelopment of forms and the formation of subjects. A hidden structure\n\nnecessary for forms, a secret signifier necessary for subjects. It ensues that\n\nthe plan(e) itself will not be given. It exists only in a supplementary dimen-\n\nsion to that to which it gives rise _(n +_1). This makes it a teleological\nplan(e),\n\na design, a mental principle. It is a plan(e) of transcendence. It is a\nplan(e)\n\nof analogy, either because it assigns the eminent term of a development or\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)288.png)\n\n0\n\n266 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL . ..\n\nbecause it establishes the proportional relations of a structure. It may be in\n\nthe mind of a god, or in the unconscious of life, of the soul, or of language:\nit\n\nis always concluded from its own effects. It is always inferred. _Even if it\nis  \nsaid to be immanent, _it is so only by absence, analogically (metaphorically,\n\nmetonymically, etc.). The tree is given in the seed, but as a function of a\n\nplan(e) that is not given. The same applies to music. The developmental or\n\norganizational principle does not appear in itself, in a direct relation with\n\nthat which develops or is organized: There is a transcendent compositional\n\nprinciple that is not of the nature of sound, that is not \"audible\" by itself\nor\n\nfor itself. This opens the way for all possible interpretations. Forms and\n\ntheir developments, and subjects and their formations, relate to a plan(e)\n\nthat operates as a transcendent unity or hidden principle. The plan(e) can\n\nalways be described, but as a part aside, as ungiven in that to which it gives\n\nrise. Is this not how even Balzac, even Proust, describe their work's plan(e)\n\nof organization or development, as though in a metalanguage? Is not\n\nStockhausen also obliged to describe the structure of his sound forms as\n\nexisting \"alongside\" them, since he is unable to make it audible? Life\n\nplan(e), music plan(e), writing plan(e), it's all the same: a plan(e) that\ncan-\n\nnot be given as such, that can only be inferred from the forms it develops\n\nand the subjects it forms, since it _is for _these forms and these subjects.\n\nThen there is an altogether different plane, or an altogether different\n\nconception of the plane. Here, there are no longer any forms or develop-\n\nments of forms; nor are there subjects or the formation of subjects. There is\n\nno structure, any more than there is genesis. There are only relations of\n\nmovement and rest, speed and slowness between unformed elements, or at\n\nleast between elements that are relatively unformed, molecules and\n\nparticles of all kinds. There are only haecceities, affects, subjectless indi-\n\nviduations that constitute collective assemblages. Nothing develops, but\n\nthings arrive late or early, and form this or that assemblage depending on\n\ntheir compositions of speed. Nothing subjectifies, but haecceities form\n\naccording to compositions of nonsubjectified powers or affects. We call\n\nthis plane, which knows only longitudes and latitudes, speeds and haec-\n\nceities, the plane of consistency or composition (as opposed to the plan(e)\n\nof organization or development). It is necessarily a plane of immanence\n\nand univocality. We therefore call it the plane of Nature, although nature\n\nhas nothing to do with it, since on this plane there is no distinction between\n\nthe natural and the artificial. However many dimensions it may have, it\n\nnever has a supplementary dimension to that which transpires upon it.\n\nThat alone makes it natural and immanent. The same goes for the principle\n\nof contradiction: this plane could also be called the plane of\n\nnoncontradiction. The plane of consistency could be called the plane of\n\nnonconsistency. It is a geometrical plane, no longer tied to a mental design\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)289.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 267\n\nbut to an abstract design. Its number of dimensions continually increases\n\nas what happens happens, but even so it loses nothing of its planitude. It is\n\nthus a plane of proliferation, peopling, contagion; but this proliferation of\n\nmaterial has nothing to do with an evolution, the development of a form or\n\nthe filiation of forms. Still less is it a regression leading back to a\nprinciple.\n\nIt is on the contrary an _involution, _in which form is constantly being dis-\n\nsolved, freeing times and speeds. It is a fixed plane, a fixed sound plane, or\n\nvisual plane, or writing plane, etc. Here, fixed does not mean immobile: it\n\nis the absolute state of movement as well as of rest, from which all relative\n\nspeeds and slownesses spring, and nothing but them. Certain modern\n\nmusicians oppose the transcendent plan(e) of organization, which is said\n\nto have dominated all of Western classical music, to the immanent sound\n\nplane, which is always given along with that to which it gives rise, brings\nthe\n\nimperceptible to perception, and carries only differential speeds and\n\nslownesses in a kind of molecular lapping: _the work of art must mark sec-  \nonds, tenths and hundredths of seconds._\n\n_46_\n\n_ _Or rather it is a question of a free-\n\ning of time, Aeon, a nonpulsed time for a floating music, as Boulez says, an\n\nelectronic music in which forms are replaced by pure modifications of\n\nspeed. It is undoubtedly John Cage who first and most perfectly deployed\n\nthis fixed sound plane, which affirms a process against all structure and\n\ngenesis, a floating time against pulsed time or tempo, experimentation\n\nagainst any kind of interpretation, and in which silence as sonorous rest\n\nalso marks the absolute state of movement. The same could be said of the\n\nfixed visual plane: Godard, for example, effectively carries the fixed\n\nplane of cinema to this state where forms dissolve, and all that subsists are\n\ntiny variations of speed between movements in composition. Nathalie\n\nSarraute, for her part, proposes a clear distinction between two planes of\n\nwriting: a transcendent plan(e) that organizes and develops forms (genres,\n\nthemes, motifs) and assigns and develops subjects (personages, characters,\n\nfeelings); and an altogether different plane that liberates the particles of\nan\n\nanonymous matter, allowing them to communicate through the \"enve-\n\nlope\" of forms and subjects, retaining between them only relations of\n\nmovement and rest, speed and slowness, floating affects, so that the plane\n\nitself is perceived at the same time as it allows us to perceive the impercep-\n\ntible (the microplane, the molecular plane).\n\n47\n\nSo from the point of view of a\n\nwell-founded abstraction, we can make it seem as though the two planes,\n\nthe two conceptions of the plane, were in clear and absolute opposition.\n\nFrom this point of view, we can say, You can see the difference between the\n\nfollowing two types of propositions: (1) forms develop and subjects form as\n\na function of a plan(e) that can only be inferred (the planfe] of organi-\n\nzation-development); (2) there are only speeds and slownesses between\n\nunformed elements, and affects between nonsubjectified powers, as a func-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)290.png)\n\n0\n\n268 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...\n\ntion of a plane that is necessarily given at the same time as that to which it\n\ngives rise (the plane of consistency or composition).\n\n48\n\nLet us consider three major cases from nineteenth-century German lit-\n\nerature, Holderlin, Kleist, and Nietzsche. First, Holderlin's extraordinary\n\ncomposition, _Hyperion, _as analyzed by Robert Rovini: the importance of\n\nhaecceities of the season type. These constitute, in two different ways, the\n\n\"frame of the narrative\" (plan[e]) and the details of what happens within\n\nthat frame (the assemblages and interassemblages).\n\n49\n\nHe also notes how the\n\nsuccession of the seasons and the superposition of the same season from\n\ndifferent years dissolves forms and persons and gives rise to movements,\n\nspeeds, delays, and affects, as if as the narrative progressed something were\n\nescaping from an impalpable matter. And perhaps also the relation to a\n\n\"realpolitik,\" to a war machine, to a musical machine of dissonance.\n\nKleist: everything with him, in his writing as in his life, becomes speed\n\nand slowness. A succession of catatonic freezes and extreme velocities,\n\nfainting spells and shooting arrows. Sleep on your steed, then take off at a\n\ngallop. Jump from one assemblage to another, with the aid of a faint, by\n\ncrossing a void. Kleist multiplies \"life plan(e)s,\" but his voids and\nfailures,\n\nhis leaps, earthquakes, and plagues are always included on a single plane.\n\nThe plane is not a principle of organization but a means of transportation.\n\nNo form develops, no subject forms; affects are displaced, becomings cata-\n\npult forward and combine into blocks, like the becoming-woman of Achil-\n\nles and the becoming-dog of Penthesilea. Kleist offers a wonderful\n\nexplanation of how forms and persons are only appearances produced by\n\nthe displacement of a center of gravity on an abstract line, and by the con-\n\njunction of these lines on a plane of immanence. He is fascinated by bears;\n\nthey are impossible to fool because their cruel little eyes see through\n\nappearances to the true \"soul of movement,\" the _Gemut _or nonsubjective\n\naffect: the becoming-bear of Kleist. Even death can only be conceptualized\n\nas the intersection of elementary reactions of different speeds. _A skull  \nexploding, _one of Kleist's obsessions. All of Kleist's work is traversed by a\n\nwar machine invoked against the State, by a musical machine invoked\n\nagainst painting or the \"picture.\" It is odd how Goethe and Hegel hated this\n\nnew kind of writing. Because for them the plan(e) must indissolubly be a\n\nharmonious development of Form and a regulated formation of the Sub-\n\nject, personage, or character (the sentimental education, the interior and\n\nsubstantial solidity of the character, the harmony or analogy of the forms\n\nand continuity of development, the cult of the State, etc.). Their concep-\n\ntion of the Plane is totally opposed to that of Kleist. The anti-Goetheism,\n\nanti-Hegelianism of Kleist, and already of Holderlin. Goethe gets to the\n\ncrux of the matter when he reproaches Kleist for simultaneously setting up\n\na pure \"stationary process\" that is like the fixed plane, introducing voids\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)291.png)\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... \u25a1 269\n\nand jumps that prevent any development of a central character, and mobi-\n\nlizing a violence of affects that causes an extreme confusion of feelings.\n\n50\n\nNietzsche does the same thing by different means. There is no longer\n\nany development of forms or formation of subjects. He criticizes Wagner\n\nfor retaining too much harmonic form, and too many pedagogical person-\n\nages, or \"characters\": too much Hegel and Goethe. Now Bizet, on the other\n\nhand, Nietzsche says ... It seems to us that fragmentary writing is not so\n\nmuch the issue in Nietzsche. It is instead speeds and slownesses: not writ-\n\ning slowly or rapidly, but rather writing, and everything else besides, as a\n\nproduction of speeds and slownesses between particles. No form will resist\n\nthat, no character or subject will survive it. Zarathustra is only speeds and\n\nslownesses, and the eternal return, the life of the eternal return, is the\nfirst\n\ngreat concrete freeing of nonpulsed time. _Ecce Homo _has only individ-\n\nuations by haecceities. It is inevitable that the Plan(e), thus conceived,\nwill\n\nalways fail, but that the failures will be an integral part of the plan(e):\nSee\n\nthe multitude of plans for _The Will to Power. _For a given aphorism, it is\n\nalways possible, even necessary, to introduce new relations of speed and\n\nslowness between its elements that truly make it change assemblages, jump\n\nfrom one assemblage to the next (the issue is therefore not the fragment).\n\nAs Cage says, it is of the nature of the plan(e) that it fail.\n\n51\n\nPrecisely because\n\nit is not a plan(e) of organization, development, or formation, but of\n\nnonvoluntary transmutation. Or Boulez: \"Program the machine so that\n\neach time a tape is played on it, it produces different time characteristics.\"\n\nSo the plan(e)\u2014life plan(e), writing plan(e), music plan(e)\u2014must neces-\n\nsarily fail for it is impossible to be faithful to it; but the failures are a\npart of\n\nthe plan(e) for the plan(e) expands or shrinks along with the dimensions of\n\nthat which it deploys in each instance (planitude of _n _dimensions). A\n\nstrange machine that is simultaneously a machine of war, music, and\n\ncontagion-proliferation-involution.\n\nWhy does the opposition between the two kinds of planes lead to a still\n\nmore abstract hypothesis? Because one continually passes from one to the\n\nother, by unnoticeable degrees and without being aware of it, or one be-\n\ncomes aware of it only afterward. Because one continually reconstitutes\n\none plane atop another, or extricates one from the other. For example, all\n\nwe need to do is to sink the floating plane of immanence, bury it in the\n\ndepths of Nature instead of allowing it to play freely on the surface, for it\nto\n\npass to the other side and assume the role of a ground that can no longer be\n\nanything more than a principle of analogy from the standpoint of organiza-\n\ntion, and a law of continuity from the standpoint of development.\n\n52\n\nThe\n\nplane of organization or development effectively covers what we have\n\ncalled stratification: Forms and subjects, organs and functions, are\n\n\"strata\" or relations between strata. The plane of consistency or imma-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)292.png)\n\n0\n\n270 D\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL.. .\n\nnence, on the other hand, implies a destratification of all of Nature, by\n\neven the most artificial of means. The plane of consistency is the body\n\nwithout organs. Pure relations of speed and slowness between particles\n\nimply movements of deterritorialization, just as pure affects imply an\n\nenterprise of desubjectification. Moreover, the plane of consistency does\n\nnot preexist the movements of deterritorialization that unravel it, the lines\n\nof flight that draw it and cause it to rise to the surface, the becomings that\n\ncompose it. The plane of organization is constantly working away at the\n\nplane of consistency, always trying to plug the lines of flight, stop or\ninter-\n\nrupt the movements of deterritorialization, weigh them down, restratify\n\nthem, reconstitute forms and subjects in a dimension of depth. Conversely,\n\nthe plane of consistency is constantly extricating itself from the plane of\n\norganization, causing particles to spin off the strata, scrambling forms by\n\ndint of speed or slowness, breaking down functions by means of assem-\n\nblages or microassemblages. But once again, so much caution is needed to\n\nprevent the plane of consistency from becoming a pure plane of abolition\n\nor death, to prevent the involution from turning into a regression to the\n\nundifferentiated. Is it not necessary to retain a minimum of strata, a mini-\n\nmum of forms and functions, a minimal subject from which to extract\n\nmaterials, affects, and assemblages?\n\nIn fact, the opposition we should set up between the two planes is that\n\nbetween two abstract poles: for example, to the transcendent, organiza-\n\ntional plane of Western music based on sound forms and their develop-\n\nment, we oppose the immanent plane of consistency of Eastern music,\n\ncomposed of speeds and slownesses, movements and rest. In keeping with\n\nour concrete hypothesis, the whole becoming of Western music, all musical\n\nbecoming, implies a minimum of sound forms and even of melodic and\n\nharmonic functions; speeds and slownesses are made to pass across them,\n\nand it is precisely these speeds and slownesses that reduce the forms and\n\nfunctions to the minimum. Beethoven produced the most astonishing\n\npolyphonic richness with relatively scanty themes of three or four notes.\n\nThere is a material proliferation that goes hand in hand with a dissolution\n\nof form (involution) but is at the same time accompanied by a continuous\n\ndevelopment of form. Perhaps Schumann's genius is the most striking case\n\nof form being developed only for the relations of speed and slowness one\n\nmaterially and emotionally assigns it. Music has always submitted its\n\nforms and motifs to temporal transformations, augmentations or diminu-\n\ntions, slowdowns or accelerations, which do not occur solely according to\n\nlaws of organization or even of development. Expanding and contracting\n\nmicrointervals are at play within coded intervals. Wagner and the\n\npost-Wagnerians free variations of speed between sound particles to an\n\neven greater extent. Ravel and Debussy retain just enough form to shatter\n\nit,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)293.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... \u25a1 271\n\naffect it, modify it through speeds and slownesses. _Bolero _is the classic\n\nexample, nearly a caricature, of a machinic assemblage that preserves a\n\nminimum of form in order to take it to the bursting point. Boulez speaks of\n\nproliferations of little motifs, accumulations of little notes that proceed\n\nkinematically and affectively, sweeping away a simple form by adding indi-\n\ncations of speed to it; this allows one to produce extremely complex\n\ndynamic relations on the basis of intrinsically simple formal relations.\n\nEven a rubato by Chopin cannot be reproduced because it will have differ-\n\nent time characteristics at each playing.\n\n53\n\nIt is as though an immense plane\n\nof consistency of variable speed were forever sweeping up forms and func-\n\ntions, forms and subjects, extracting from them particles and affects. A\n\nclock keeping a whole assortment of times.\n\nWhat is a girl, what is a group of girls? Proust at least has shown us once\n\nand for all that their individuation, collective or singular, proceeds not by\n\nsubjectivity but by haecceity, pure haecceity. \"Fugitive beings.\" They are\n\npure relations of speeds and slownesses, and nothing else. A girl is late on\n\naccount of her speed: she did too many things, crossed too many spaces in\n\nrelation to the relative time of the person waiting for her. Thus her apparent\n\nslowness is transformed into the breakneck speed of our waiting. It must be\n\nsaid in this connection, and for the whole of the _Recherche du temps perdu, _\n\nthat Swann does not at all occupy the same position as the narrator. Swann\n\nis not a rough sketch or precursor of the narrator, except secondarily and at\n\nrare moments. They are not at all on the same _plane. _Swann is always think-\n\ning and feeling in terms of subjects, forms, resemblances between subjects,\n\nand correspondences between forms. For him, one of Odette's lies is a form\n\nwhose secret subjective content must be discovered, provoking amateur\n\ndetective activity. To him Vinteuil's music is a form that must evoke some-\n\nthing else, fall back on something else, echo other forms, whether paint-\n\nings, faces, or landscapes. Although the narrator may follow in Swann's\n\nfootsteps, he is nonetheless in a different element, on a different plane. One\n\nof Albertine's lies is nearly devoid of content; it tends on the contrary to\n\nmerge with the emission of a particle issuing from the eyes of the beloved, a\n\nparticle that stands only for itself and travels too fast through the\nnarrator's\n\nauditory or visual field. This molecular speed is unbearable because it\n\nindicates a distance, a _proximity _where Albertine would like to be, and\n\nalready is.\n\n54\n\nSo that the narrator's pose is not principally that of the investi-\n\ngating detective but (a very different figure) that of the jailer. How can he\n\nbecome master of speed, how can he stand it nervously (as a headache) and\n\nperceptually (as a flash)? How can he build a prison for Albertine? Jealousy\n\nis different in Swann and the narrator, as is the perception of music:\n\nVinteuil gradually ceases to be apprehended in terms of forms and compa-\n\nrable subjects, and assumes incredible speeds and slownesses that combine\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)294.png)\n\n0\n\n272 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\non a plane of consistency of variation, the plane of music and of the  \n_Recherche _(just as Wagnerian motifs abandon all fixity of form and all\n\nassignation of personages). It is as though Swann's desperate efforts to\n\nreterritorialize the flow of things (to reterritorialize Odette on a secret,\n\npainting on a face, music on the Bois de Boulogne) were replaced by the\n\nsped-up movement of deterritorialization, by a linear speedup of the\n\nabstract machine, sweeping away faces and landscapes, and then love, jeal-\n\nousy, painting, and music itself, according to increasingly stronger coeffi-\n\ncients that nourish the Work at risk of dissolving everything and dying. For\n\nthe narrator, despite partial victories, fails in his project; that project\nwas\n\nnot at all to regain time or to force back memories, but to become master of\n\nspeeds to the rhythm of his asthma. It was to face annihilation. But another\n\noutcome was possible, or was made possible by Proust.\n\n_**Memories of a Molecule. **_Becoming-animal is only one becoming among\n\nothers. A kind of order or apparent progression can be established for the\n\nsegments of becoming in which we find ourselves; becoming-woman,\n\nbecoming-child; becoming-animal, -vegetable, or -mineral;\n\nbecomings-molecular of all kinds, becomings-particles. Fibers lead us\n\nfrom one to the other, transform one into the other as they pass through\n\ndoors and across thresholds. Singing or composing, painting, writing have\n\nno other aim: to unleash these becomings. Especially music; music is\n\ntraversed by a becoming-woman, becoming-child, and not only at the level\n\nof themes and motifs: the little refrain, children's games and dances,\n\nchildhood scenes. Instrumentation and orchestration are permeated by\n\nbecomings-animal, above all becomings-bird, but many others besides. The\n\nlapping, wailing of molecular discordances have always been present,\n\neven if instrumental evolution with other factors is now giving them\n\ngrowing importance, as the value of a new threshold for a properly\n\nmusical content: the sound molecule, relations of speed and slowness\n\nbetween particles. Becomings-animal plunge into becomings-molecular.\n\nThis raises all kinds of questions.\n\nIn a way, we must start at the end: all becomings are already molecular.\n\nThat is because becoming is not to imitate or identify with something or\n\nsomeone. Nor is it to proportion formal relations. Neither of these two fig-\n\nures of analogy is applicable to becoming: neither the imitation of a subject\n\nnor the proportionality of a form. Starting from the forms one has, the sub-\n\nject one is, the organs one has, or the functions one fulfills, becoming is to\n\nextract particles between which one establishes the relations of movement\n\nand rest, speed and slowness that are _closest _to what one is becoming, and\n\nthrough which one becomes.

Rather, he snatches from his\n\nown language verbal particles that can no longer belong to the form of that\n\nlanguage, just as he snatches from food alimentary particles that no longer\n\nact as formed nutritional substances; the two kinds of particles enter into\n\nproximity. We could also put it this way: Becoming is to emit particles that\n\ntake on certain relations of movement and rest because they enter a partic-\n\nular zone of proximity. Or, it is to emit particles that enter that zone\n\nbecause they take on those relations. A haecceity is inseparable from the\n\nfog and mist that depend on a molecular zone, a corpuscular space. Prox-\n\nimity is a notion, at once topological and quantal, that marks a belonging to\n\nthe same molecule, independently of the subjects considered and the forms\n\ndetermined.\n\nScherer and Hocquenghem made this essential point in their reconsid-\n\neration of the problem of wolf-children. Of course, it is not a question of a\n\nreal production, as if the child \"really\" became an animal; nor is it a ques-\n\ntion of a resemblance, as if the child imitated animals that really raised it;\n\nnor is it a question of a symbolic metaphor, as if the autistic child that was\n\nabandoned or lost merely became the \"analogue\" of an animal. Scherer\n\nand Hocquenghem are right to expose this false reasoning, which is based\n\non a culturalism or moralism upholding the irreducibility of the human\n\norder: Because the child has not been transformed into an animal, it must\n\nonly have a metaphorical relation to it, induced by the child's illness or\n\nrejection. For their own part, they appeal to an objective zone of\n\nindetermi-nation or uncertainty, \"something shared or indiscernible,\" a\n\nproximity \"that makes it impossible to say where the boundary between\n\nthe human and animal lies,\" not only in the case of autistic children, but\n\nfor all children; it is as though, independent of the evolution carrying\n\nthem toward adulthood, there were room in the child for other\n\nbecomings, \"other contemporaneous possibilities\" that are not\n\nregressions but creative involutions bearing witness to _\"an inhumanity  \nimmediately experienced in the body as such,\" _unnatural nuptials\n\n\"outside the programmed body.\" There is a reality of becoming-animal,\n\neven though one does not in reality become animal.

For what needs to be explained is precisely the fact that all chil-\n\ndren, and even many adults, do it to a greater or lesser degree, and in so\n\ndoing bear witness to an inhuman connivance with the animal, rather than\n\nan Oedipal symbolic community.\n\n57\n\nNeither should it be thought that chil-\n\ndren who graze, or eat dirt or raw flesh, are merely getting the vitamins and\n\nminerals they need. It is a question of composing a body with the animal, a\n\nbody without organs defined by zones of intensity or proximity. Where\n\ndoes this objective indetermination or indiscernibility of which Scherer\n\nand Hocquenghem speak come from?\n\nAn example: Do not imitate a dog, but make your organism enter into\n\ncomposition with _something else _in such a way that the particles emitted\n\nfrom the aggregate thus composed will be canine as a function of the rela-\n\ntion of movement and rest, or of molecular proximity, into which they\n\nenter. Clearly, this something else can be quite varied, and be more or less\n\ndirectly related to the animal in question: it can be the animal's natural\n\nfood (dirt and worm), or its exterior relations with other animals (you can\n\nbecome-dog with cats, or become-monkey with a horse), or an apparatus or\n\nprosthesis to which a person subjects the animal (muzzle and reindeer,\n\netc.), or something that does not even have a localizable relation to the ani-\n\nmal in question. For this last case, we have seen how Slepian bases his\n\nattempt to become-dog on the idea of tying shoes to his hands using his\n\nmouth-muzzle. Philippe Gavi cites the performances of Lolito, an eater of\n\nbottles, earthenware, porcelains, iron, and even bicycles, who declares: \"I\n\nconsider myself half-animal, half-man. More animal than man. I love ani-\n\nmals, dogs especially, I feel a bond with them. My teeth have adapted; in\n\nfact, when I don't eat glass or iron, my jaw aches like a young dog's that\n\ncraves to chew a bone.\"\n\n58\n\nIf we interpret the word \"like\" as a metaphor, or\n\npropose a structural analogy of relations (man-iron = dog-bone), we under-\n\nstand nothing of becoming. The word \"like\" is one of those words that\n\nchange drastically in meaning and function when they are used in connec-\n\ntion with haecceities, when they are made into expressions of becomings\n\ninstead of signified states or signifying relations. A dog may exercise its\njaw\n\non iron, but when it does it is using its jaw as a molar organ. When Lolito\n\neats iron, it is totally different: he makes his jaw enter into composition\n\nwith the iron in such a way that he himself becomes the jaw of a molecular\n\ndog. The actor Robert De Niro walks \"like\" a crab in a certain film\n\nsequence; but, he says, it is not a question of his imitating a crab; it is a\nques-\n\ntion of making something that has to do with the crab enter into composi-\n\ntion with the image, with the speed of the image.\n\n59\n\nThat is the essential\n\npoint for us: you become-animal only if, by whatever means or elements,\n\nyou emit corpuscles that enter the relation of movement and rest of the ani-\n\nmal particles, or what amounts to the same thing, that enter the zone of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)297.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

You become animal only molecularly.\n\nYou do not become a barking molar dog, but by barking, if it is done with\n\nenough feeling, with enough necessity and composition, you emit a molec-\n\nular dog. Man does not become wolf, or vampire, as if he changed molar\n\nspecies; the vampire and werewolf are becomings of man, in other words,\n\nproximities between molecules in composition, relations of movement\n\nand rest, speed and slowness between emitted particles. Of course there are\n\nwerewolves and vampires, we say this with all our heart; but do not look for\n\na resemblance or analogy to the animal, for this is becoming-animal in\n\naction, the production of the molecular animal (whereas the \"real\" animal\n\nis trapped in its molar form and subjectivity). It is within us that the\nanimal\n\nbares its teeth like Hofmannsthal's rat, or the flower opens its petals; but\n\nthis is done by corpuscular emission, by molecular proximity, and not by\n\nthe imitation of a subject or a proportionality of form. Albertine can always\n\nimitate a flower, but it is when she is sleeping and enters into composition\n\nwith the particles of sleep that her beauty spot and the texture of her skin\n\nenter a relation of rest and movement that place her in the zone of a molec-\n\nular vegetable: the becoming-plant of Albertine. And it is when she is held\n\nprisoner that she emits the particles of a bird. And it is when she flees,\n\nlaunches down a line of flight, that she becomes-horse, even if it is the\nhorse\n\nof death.\n\nYes, all becomings are molecular: the animal, flower, or stone one\n\nbecomes are molecular collectivities, haecceities, not molar subjects,\n\nobjects, or form that we know from the outside and recognize from experi-\n\nence, through science, or by habit. If this is true, then we must say the same\n\nof things human: there is a becoming-woman, a becoming-child, that do\n\nnot resemble the woman or the child as clearly distinct molar entities (al-\n\nthough it is possible\u2014only possible\u2014for the woman or child to occupy\n\nprivileged positions in relation to these becomings). What we term a molar\n\nentity is, for example, the woman as defined by her form, endowed with\n\norgans and functions and assigned as a subject. Becoming-woman is not\n\nimitating this entity or even transforming oneself into it. We are not, how-\n\never, overlooking the importance of imitation, or moments of imitation,\n\namong certain homosexual males, much less the prodigious attempt at a\n\nreal transformation on the part of certain transvestites. All we are saying is\n\nthat these indissociable aspects of becoming-woman must first be under-\n\nstood as a function of something else: not imitating or assuming the female\n\nform, but emitting particles that enter the relation of movement and rest,\n\nor the zone of proximity, of a microfemininity, in other words, that produce\n\nin us a molecular woman, create the molecular woman.

But it is dan-\n\ngerous to confine oneself to such a subject, which does not function with-\n\nout drying up a spring or stopping a flow. The song of life is often intoned\n\nby the driest of women, moved by _ressentiment, _the will to power and cold\n\nmothering. Just as a dessicated child makes a much better child, there\n\nbeing no childhood flow emanating from it any longer. It is no more ade-\n\nquate to say that each sex contains the other and must develop the opposite\n\npole in itself. Bisexuality is no better a concept than the separateness of\nthe\n\nsexes. It is as deplorable to miniaturize, internalize the binary machine as\n\nit is to exacerbate it; it does not extricate us from it. It is thus necessary\nto\n\nconceive of a molecular women's politics that slips into molar confronta-\n\ntions, and passes under or through them.\n\nWhen Virginia Woolf was questioned about a specifically women's writ-\n\ning, she was appalled at the idea of writing \"as a woman.\" Rather, writing\n\nshould produce a becoming-woman as atoms of womanhood capable of\n\ncrossing and impregnating an entire social field, and of contaminating\n\nmen, of sweeping them up in that becoming. Very soft particles\u2014but also\n\nvery hard and obstinate, irreducible, indomitable. The rise of women in\n\nEnglish novel writing has spared no man: even those who pass for the most\n\nvirile, the most phallocratic, such as Lawrence and Miller, in their turn\n\ncontinually tap into and emit particles that enter the proximity or zone of\n\nindiscernibility of women. In writing, they become-women. The question\n\nis not, or not only, that of the organism, history, and subject of enunciation\n\nthat oppose masculine to feminine in the great dualism machines. The\n\nquestion is fundamentally that of the body\u2014the body they _steal _from us in\n\norder to fabricate opposable organisms. This body is stolen first from the\n\ngirl: Stop behaving like that, you're not a little girl anymore, you're not a\n\ntomboy, etc. The girl's becoming is stolen first, in order to impose a\nhistory,\n\nor prehistory, upon her. The boy's turn comes next, but it is by using the\ngirl\n\nas an example, by pointing to the girl as the object of his desire, that an\n\nopposed organism, a dominant history is fabricated for him too. The girl is\n\nthe first victim, but she must also serve as an example and a trap. That is\n\nwhy, conversely, the reconstruction of the body as a Body without Organs,\n\nthe anorganism of the body, is inseparable from a becoming-woman, or the\n\nproduction of a molecular woman. Doubtless, the girl becomes a woman in\n\nthe molar or organic sense. But conversely, becoming-woman or the molec-\n\nular woman is the girl herself. The girl is certainly not defined by\nvirginity;\n\nshe is defined by a relation of movement and rest, speed and slowness, by a\n\ncombination of atoms, an emission of particles: haecceity.

The only way to get outside the dualisms is to be-between, to\n\npass between, the intermezzo\u2014that is what Virginia Woolf lived with all\n\nher energies, in all of her work, never ceasing to become. The girl is like\nthe\n\nblock of becoming that remains contemporaneous to each opposable term,\n\nman, woman, child, adult. It is not the girl who becomes a woman; it is\n\nbecoming-woman that produces the universal girl. Trost, a mysterious\n\nauthor, painted a portrait of the girl, to whom he linked the fate of the\nrevo-\n\nlution: her speed, her freely machinic body, her intensities, her abstract\n\nline or line of flight, her molecular production, her indifference to mem-\n\nory, her nonfigurative character\u2014\"the nonfigurative of desire.\"\n\n60\n\nJoan of\n\nArc?

But it is also certain that girls and children\ndraw\n\ntheir strength neither from the molar status that subdues them nor from\n\nthe organism and subjectivity they receive; they draw their strength from\n\nthe becoming-molecular they cause to pass between sexes and ages, the\n\nbecoming-child of the adult as well as of the child, the becoming-woman of\n\nthe man as well as of the woman. The girl and the child do not become; it is\n\nbecoming itself that is a child or a girl. The child does not become an adult\n\nany more than the girl becomes a woman; the girl is the becoming-woman\n\nof each sex, just as the child is the becoming-young of every age. Knowing\n\nhow to age does not mean remaining young; it means extracting from one's\n\nage the particles, the speeds and slownesses, the flows that constitute the\n\nyouth _of that _age. Knowing how to love does not mean remaining a man or a\n\nwoman; it means extracting from one's sex the particles, the speeds and\n\nslownesses, the flows, the _n _sexes that constitute the girl _of that\n_sexuality.

It is the key to all the other becomings. When\n\nthe man of war disguises himself as a woman, flees disguised as a girl, hides\n\nas a girl, it is not a shameful, transitory incident in his life.

This phenomenon can only be under-\n\nstood in terms of becoming. We have seen how the man of war, by virtue of  \n_his furor _and celerity, was swept up in irresistible becomings-animal. These\n\nare becomings that have as their necessary condition the becoming-woman\n\nof the warrior, or his alliance with the girl, his contagion with her. The man\n\nof war is inseparable from the Amazons. The union of the girl and the man\n\nof war does not produce animals, but simultaneously produces the\n\nbecoming-woman of the latter and the becoming-animal of the former, in a\n\nsingle \"block\" in which the warrior in turn becomes animal by contagion\n\nwith the girl at the same time as the girl becomes warrior by contagion with\n\nthe animal. Everything ties together in an asymmetrical block of becom-\n\ning, an instantaneous zigzag. It is in the vestiges of a double war machine\u2014\n\nthat of the Greeks, soon to be supplanted by the State, and that of the\n\nAmazons, soon to be dissolved\u2014that Achilles and Penthesilea, the last\n\nman of war and the last queen of the girls, choose one another, Achilles in a\n\nbecoming-woman, Penthesilea in a becoming-dog.\n\nThe rites of transvestism or female impersonation in primitive societies\n\nin which a man becomes a woman are not explainable by a social organiza-\n\ntion that places the given relations in correspondence, or by a psychic\n\norganization that makes the woman desire to become a man just as the man\n\ndesires to become a woman.\n\n62\n\nSocial structure and psychic identification\n\nleave too many special factors unaccounted for: the linkage, unleashing,\n\nand communication of the becomings triggered by the transvestite; the\n\npower _(puissance) _of the resultant becoming-animal; and above all the par-\n\nticipation of these becomings in a specific war machine. The same applies\n\nfor sexuality: it is badly explained by the binary organization of the sexes,\n\nand just as badly by a bisexual organization within each sex. Sexuality\n\nbrings into play too great a diversity of conjugated becomings; these are\n\nlike _n _sexes, an entire war machine through which love passes.

Without a doubt, toward becoming-imperceptible. The\n\nimperceptible is the immanent end of becoming, its cosmic formula. For\n\nexample, Matheson's _Shrinking Man _passes through the kingdoms of\n\nnature, slips between molecules, to become an unfindable particle in infi-\n\nnite meditation on the infinite. Paul Morand's _Monsieur Zero _flees the\n\nlarger countries, crosses the smallest ones, descends the scale of States,\n\nestablishes an anonymous society in Lichtenstein of which he is the only\n\nmember, and dies imperceptible, forming the particle 0 with his fingers: \"I\n\nam a man who flees by swimming under water, and at whom all the world's\n\nrifles fire. ... I must no longer offer a target.\" But what does\n\nbecoming-imperceptible signify, coming at the end of all the molecular\n\nbecomings that begin with becoming-woman? Becoming-imperceptible\n\nmeans many things. What is the relation between the (anorganic)\n\nimperceptible, the (asignifying) indiscernible, and the (asubjective)\n\nimpersonal?\n\nA first response would be: to be like everybody else. That is what\n\nKierkegaard relates in his story about the \"knight of the faith,\" the man of\n\nbecoming: to look at him, one would notice nothing, a bourgeois, nothing\n\nbut a bourgeois.

It is by conjugating, by continuing with\n\nother lines, other pieces, that one makes a world that can overlay the first\n\none, like a transparency. Animal elegance, the camouflage fish, the clan-\n\ndestine: this fish is crisscrossed by abstract lines that resemble nothing,\n\nthat do not even follow its organic divisions; but thus disorganized,\n\ndisarticulated, it worlds with the lines of a rock, sand, and plants, becoming\n\nimperceptible. The fish is like the Chinese poet: not imitative or structural,\n\nbut cosmic. Francois Cheng shows that poets do not pursue resemblance,\n\nany more than they calculate \"geometric proportions.\" They retain, extract\n\nonly the essential lines and movements of nature; they proceed only by\n\ncontinued or superposed \"traits,\" or strokes.\n\n63\n\nIt is in this sense that\n\nbecoming-everybody/everything, making the world a becoming, is to\n\nworld, to make a world or worlds, in other words, to find one's proximities\n\nand zones of indiscernibility.

Kerouac's dream, and\n\nalready Virginia Woolf s, was for the writing to be like the line of a Chinese\n\npoem-drawing. She says that it is necessary to \"saturate every atom,\" and\n\nto do that it is necessary to eliminate, to eliminate all that is resemblance\n\nand analogy, but also \"to put everything into it\": eliminate everything that\n\nexceeds the moment, but put in everything that it includes\u2014and the\n\nmoment is not the instantaneous, it is the haecceity into which one slips\n\nand that slips into other haecceities by transparency.\n\n64\n\nTo be present at the\n\ndawn of the world.

To reduce oneself to an\n\nabstract line, a trait, in order to find one's zone of indiscernibility with\n\nother traits, and in this way enter the haecceity and impersonality of the\n\ncreator. One is then like grass: one has made the world, everybody/\n\neverything, into a becoming, because one has made a necessarily commu-\n\nnicating world, because one has suppressed in oneself everything that\n\nprevents us from slipping between things and growing in the midst of\n\nthings.

What we must do is\n\nreach the photographic or cinematic threshold; but in relation to the\n\nphotograph, movement and affect once again took refuge above and below.\n\nWhen Kierkegaard adopts the marvelous motto, \"I look only at the move-\n\nments,\"\n\n65\n\nhe is acting astonishingly like a precursor of the cinema, multi-\n\nplying versions of a love scenario (between Agnes and the merman)\n\naccording to variable speeds and slownesses. He has all the more reason to\n\nsay that there is no movement that is not infinite; that the movement of the\n\ninfinite can occur only by means of affect, passion, love, in a becoming that\n\nis the girl, but without reference to any kind of \"mediation\"; and that this\n\nmovement as such eludes any mediating perception because it is already\n\neffectuated at every moment, and the dancer or lover finds him- or herself\n\nalready \"awake and walking\" the second he or she falls down, and even the\n\ninstant he or she leaps.\n\n66\n\nMovement, like the girl as a fugitive being, cannot\n\nbe perceived.\n\nHowever, we are obliged to make an immediate correction: movement\n\nalso \"must\" be perceived, it cannot but be perceived, the imperceptible is\n\nalso the _percipiendum. _There is no contradiction in this. If movement is\n\nimperceptible by nature, it is so always in relation to a given threshold of\n\nperception, which is by nature relative and thus plays the role of a media-\n\ntion on the plane that effects the distribution of thresholds and percepts\n\nand makes forms perceivable to perceiving subjects. It is the plane of\n\norganization and development, the plane of transcendence, that renders\n\nperceptible without itself being perceived, without being capable of being\n\nperceived. But on the _other _plane, the plane of immanence or consistency,\n\nthe principle of composition itself must be perceived, cannot but be per-\n\nceived at the same time as that which it composes or renders. In this case,\n\nmovement is no longer tied to the mediation of a relative threshold that it\n\neludes ad infinitum; it has reached, regardless of its speed or slowness, an\n\nabsolute but differentiated threshold that is one with the construction of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)304.png)\n\n0\n\n282 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nthis or that region of the continued plane. It could also be said that move-\n\nment ceases to be the procedure of an always relative deterritorialization,\n\nbecoming the process of absolute deterritorialization. The difference\n\nbetween the two planes accounts for the fact that what cannot be perceived\n\non one cannot but be perceived on the other. It is in jumping from one plane\n\nto the other, or from the relative thresholds to the absolute threshold that\n\ncoexists with them, that the imperceptible becomes necessarily perceived.\n\nKierkegaard shows that the plane of the infinite, which he calls the plane of\n\nfaith, must become a pure plane of immanence that continually and imme-\n\ndiately imparts, reimparts, and regathers the finite: unlike the man of infi-\n\nnite resignation, the knight of the faith or man of becoming will get the\ngirl,\n\nhe will have all of the finite and perceive the imperceptible, as \"heir appar-\n\nent to the finite.\"\n\n67\n\nPerception will no longer reside in the relation between a\n\nsubject and an object, but rather in the movement serving as the limit of\n\nthat relation, in the period associated with the subject and object. Percep-\n\ntion will confront its own limit; it will be in the midst of things,\nthroughout\n\nits own proximity, as the presence of one haecceity in another, the\n\nprehension of one by the other or the passage from one to the other: Look\n\nonly at the movements.\n\nIt is odd that the word \"faith\" should be used to designate a plane that\n\nworks by immanence. But if the knight is the man of becoming, then there\n\nare all kinds of knights. Are there not even knights of narcotics, in the\nsense\n\nthat faith is a drug (in a way very different from the sense in which religion\n\nis an opiate)? These knights claim that drugs, under necessary conditions\n\nof caution and experimentation, are inseparable from the deployment of a\n\nplane. And on this plane not only are becomings-woman,\n\nbecomings-animal, becomings-molecular, becomings-imperceptible\n\nconjugated, but the imperceptible itself becomes necessarily perceived at\n\nthe same time as perception becomes necessarily molecular: arrive at\n\nholes, microintervals between matters, colors and sounds engulfing lines\n\nof flight, world lines, lines of transparency and intersection.\n\n68\n\n_Change _\n\n_perception; _the problem has been formulated correctly because it presents\n\n\"drugs\" as a pregnant whole free of secondary distinctions (hallucinatory\n\nor nonhallucinatory, hard or soft, etc.). All drugs fundamentally concern\n\nspeeds, and modifications of speed. What allows us to describe an overall\n\nDrug assemblage in spite of the differences between drugs is a line of\n\nperceptive causality that makes it so that (1) the imperceptible is perceived;\n\n(2) perception is molecular; (3) desire directly invests the perception and\n\nthe perceived. The Americans of the beat generation had already\n\nembarked on this path, and spoke of a molecular revolution specific to\n\ndrugs. Then came Castaneda's broad synthesis.

But at this point everything reconnects: again, the problem\n\nis well formulated if we say that drugs eliminate forms and persons, if we\n\nbring into play the mad speeds of drugs and the extraordinary posthigh\n\nslownesses, if we clasp one to the other like wrestlers, if we confer upon\nper-\n\nception the molecular power to grasp microperceptions, microoperations,\n\nand upon the perceived the force to emit accelerated or decelerated parti-\n\ncles in a floating time that is no longer our time, and to emit haecceities\nthat\n\nare no longer of this world: deterritorialization, \"I was disoriented . . .\"\n(a\n\nperception of things, thoughts, desires in which desire, thought, and the\n\nthing have invaded all of perception: the imperceptible finally perceived).\n\nNothing left but the world of speeds and slownesses without form, without\n\nsubject, without a face.

Invoking causali-\n\nties that are too general or are extrinsic (psychological or sociological) is\nas\n\ngood as saying nothing. There is a discourse on drugs current today that\n\ndoes no more than dredge up generalities on pleasure and misfortune, on\n\ndifficulties in communication, on causes that always come from some-\n\nwhere else. The more incapable people are of grasping a specific causality\n\nin extension, the more they pretend to understand the phenomenon in\n\nquestion. There is no doubt that an assemblage never contains a causal\n\ninfrastructure. It does have, however, and to the highest degree, an abstract\n\nline of creative or specific causality, its _line of flight or of\ndeterritorializa-  \ntion; _this line can be effectuated only in connection with general\ncausalities\n\nof another nature, but is in no way explained by them. It is our belief that\n\nthe issue of drugs can be understood only at the level where desire directly\n\ninvests perception, and perception becomes molecular at the same time as\n\nthe imperceptible is perceived. Drugs then appear as the agent of this\n\nbecoming. This is where pharmacoanalysis would come in, which must be\n\nboth compared and contrasted to psychoanalysis.

But this schema still relies on a plane of organization that can never\nbe\n\napprehended in itself, that is always concluded from something else, that is\n\nalways inferred, concealed from the system of perception: it is called the\n\nUnconscious. Thus the plane of the Unconscious remains a plane of tran-\n\nscendence guaranteeing, justifying, the existence of psychoanalysis and the\n\nnecessity of its interpretations. This plane of the Unconscious stands in\n\nmolar opposition to the perception-consciousness system, and because\n\ndesire must be _translated _onto this plane, it is itself linked to gross\n\nmolarities, like the submerged part of an iceberg (the Oedipal structure, or\n\nthe rock of castration). The imperceptible thus remains all the more imper-\n\nceptible because it is opposed to the perceived in a dualism machine.\n\nEverything is different on the plane of consistency or immanence, which is\n\nnecessarily perceived in its own right in the course of its construction:\n\nexperimentation replaces interpretation, now molecular, nonfigurative,\n\nand nonsymbolic, the unconscious as such is given in microperceptions;\n\ndesire directly invests the field of perception, where the imperceptible\n\nappears as the perceived object of desire itself, \"the nonfigurative of\n\ndesire.\" The unconscious no longer designates the hidden principle of the\n\ntranscendent plane of organization, but the process of the immanent plane\n\nof consistency as it appears on itself in the course of its construction. For\n\nthe unconscious must be constructed, not rediscovered. There is no longer\n\na conscious-unconscious dualism machine, because the unconscious is, or\n\nrather is produced, there where consciousness goes, carried by the plane.\n\n71\n\nDrugs give the unconscious the immanence and plane that psychoanalysis\n\nhas consistently botched (perhaps the famous cocaine episode marked a\n\nturning point that forced Freud to renounce a direct approach to the\n\nunconscious).\n\nBut if it is true that drugs are linked to this immanent, molecular percep-\n\ntive causality, we are still faced with the question of whether they actually\n\nsucceed in drawing the plane necessary for their action. The causal line, or\n\nthe line of flight, of drugs is constantly being segmentarized under the most\n\nrigid of forms, that of dependency, the hit and the dose, the dealer. Even in\n\nits supple form, it can mobilize gradients and thresholds of perception\n\ntoward becomings-animal, becomings-molecular, but even this is done in\n\nthe context of a relativity of thresholds that restrict themselves to\nimitating\n\na plane of consistency rather than drawing it on an absolute threshold.\n\nWhat good does it do to perceive as fast as a quick-flying bird if speed and\n\nmovement continue to escape somewhere else? The deterritorializations\n\nremain relative, compensated for by the most abject reterritorializations,\n\nso that the imperceptible and perception continually pursue or run after\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)307.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

Drugs do not guarantee immanence; rather,\n\nthe immanence of drugs allows one to forgo them. Is it cowardice or exploi-\n\ntation to wait until others have taken the risks? No, it is joining an under-\n\ntaking in the middle, while changing the means. It is necessary to choose\n\nthe right molecule, the water, hydrogen, or helium molecule. This has noth-\n\ning to do with models, all models are molar: it is necessary to determine the\n\nmolecules and particles in relation to which \"proximities\"\n\n(indiscern-ibilities, becomings) are engendered and defined. The vital\n\nassemblage, the life-assemblage, is _theoretically or logically _possible with\n\nall kinds of molecules, silicon, for example. But it so happens that this\n\nassemblage is not _machinically _possible with silicon: the abstract machine\n\ndoes not let it pass because it does not distribute zones of proximity that\n\nconstruct the plane of consistency.\n\n74\n\nWe shall see that machinic reasons are\n\nentirely different from logical reasons or possibilities. One does not\n\nconform to a model, one straddles the right horse. Drug users have not\n\nchosen the right molecule or the right horse.

For on the one hand, the secret as\n\ncontent is superseded by a perception of the secret, which is no less secret\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)309.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 287\n\nthan the secret. It matters little what the goal is, and whether the aim of\nthe\n\nperception is a denunciation, final divulging, or disclosure. From an anec-\n\ndotal standpoint, the perception of the secret is the opposite of the secret,\n\nbut from the standpoint of the concept, it is a part of it. What counts is\nthat\n\nthe perception of the secret must necessarily be secret itself: the spy, the\n\nvoyeur, the blackmailer, the author of anonymous letters are no less secre-\n\ntive than what they are in a position to disclose, regardless of their\nulterior\n\nmotives. There is always a woman, a child, a bird to secretly perceive the\n\nsecret. There is always a perception finer than yours, a perception of your\n\nimperceptible, of what is in your box. We can even envision a profession of\n\nsecrecy for those who are in a position to perceive the secret. The protector\n\nof the secret is not necessarily in on it, but is also tied to a perception,\nsince\n\nhe or she must perceive and detect those who wish to discover the secret\n\n(counterespionage). There is thus a first direction, in which the secret\n\nmoves toward an equally secretive perception, a perception that seeks to be\n\nimperceptible itself. A wide variety of very different figures may revolve\n\naround this first point. And then there is a second point, just as inseparable\n\nfrom the secret as its content: the way in which it imposes itself and\n\nspreads. Once again, whatever the finalities or results, the secret has a way\n\nof spreading that is in turn shrouded in secrecy. The secret as secretion. The\n\nsecret must sneak, insert, or introduce itself into the arena of public forms;\n\nit must pressure them and prod known subjects into action (we are refer-\n\nring to influence of the \"lobby\" type, even if the lobby is not in itself a\nsecret\n\nsociety).\n\nIn short, the secret, defined as a content that has hidden its form in favor\n\nof a simple container, is inseparable from two movements that can acci-\n\ndentally interrupt its course or betray it, but are nonetheless an essential\n\npart of it: something must ooze from the box, something will be perceived\n\nthrough the box or in the half-opened box. The secret was invented by soci-\n\nety; it is a sociological or social notion. Every secret is a collective\nassem-\n\nblage. The secret is not at all an immobilized or static notion. Only\n\nbecomings are secrets; the secret has a becoming. The secret has its origin\n\nin the war machine; it is the war machine and its becomings-woman,\n\nbecomings-child, becomings-animal that bring the secret.\n\n75\n\nA secret soci-\n\nety always acts in society as a war machine. Sociologists who have studied\n\nsecret societies have determined many of their laws: protection,\n\nequalization and hierarchy, silence, ritual, deindividuation, centraliza-\n\ntion, autonomy, compartmentalization, etc.\n\n76\n\nBut perhaps they have not\n\ngiven enough weight to the principal laws governing the movement of con-\n\ntent: (1) every secret society has a still more secret hindsociety, which\neither\n\nperceives the secret, protects it, or metes out the punishment for its disclo-\n\nsure (it is not at all begging the question to define the secret society by\nthe\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)310.png)\n\n0\n\n288 D\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\npresence of a secret hindsociety: a society is secret when it exhibits this\n\ndoubling, has this special section); (2) every secret society has its own mode\n\nof action, which is in turn secret; the secret society may act by influence,\n\ncreeping, insinuation, oozing, pressure, or invisible rays; \"passwords\" and\n\nsecret languages (there is no contradiction here; the secret society cannot\n\nlive without the universal project of permeating all of society, of creeping\n\ninto all of the forms of society, disrupting its hierarchy and segmentation;\n\nthe secret hierarchy conjugates with a conspiracy of equals, it commands\n\nits members to swim in society as fish in water, but conversely society must\n\nbe like water around fish; it needs the complicity of the entire surrounding\n\nsociety). This is evident in cases as diverse as the mob groups of the United\n\nStates and the animal-men of Africa: on the one hand, there is the mode of\n\ninfluence of the secret society and its leaders on the political or public\nfig-\n\nures of its surroundings; and on the other hand, there is the secret society's\n\nmode of doubling itself with a hindsociety, which may constitute a special\n\nsection of killers or guards.\n\n77\n\nInfluence and doubling, secretion and concre-\n\ntion, every secret operates between two \"discreets\" _[discrets: _also\n\"discrete\n\n(terms)\"\u2014Trans.] that can, moreover, link or meld in certain cases. The\n\nchild's secret combines these elements to marvelous effect: the secret as a\n\ncontent in a box, the secret influence and propagation of the secret, the\n\nsecret perception of the secret (the child's secret is not composed of minia-\n\nturized adult secrets but is necessarily accompanied by a secret perception\n\nof the adult secret). A child discovers a secret...\n\nBut the becoming of the secret compels it not to content itself with con-\n\ncealing its form in a simple container, or with swapping it for a container.\n\nThe secret, as secret, must now acquire its own form. The secret is elevated\n\nfrom a finite content to the infinite form of secrecy. This is the point at\n\nwhich the secret attains absolute imperceptibility, instead of being linked\n\nto a whole interplay of relative perceptions and reactions. We go from a\n\ncontent that is well defined, localized, and belongs to the past, to the a\npri-\n\nori general form of a nonlocalizable _something _that has happened. We go\n\nfrom the secret defined as a hysterical childhood content to secrecy\n\ndefined as an eminently virile paranoid form. And this form displays the\n\nsame two concomitants of the secret, the secret perception and the mode of\n\naction by secret influence; but these concomitants have become \"traits\" of\n\na form they ceaselessly reconstitute, reform, recharge. On the one hand,\n\nparanoiacs denounce the international plot of those who steal their secrets,\n\ntheir most intimate thoughts; or they declare that they have the gift of per-\n\nceiving the secrets of others before they have formed (someone with para-\n\nnoid jealousy does not apprehend the other in the act of escaping; they\n\ndivine or foresee the slightest intention of it). On the other hand, paranoi-\n\nacs act by means of, or else suffer from, rays they emit or receive (Raymond\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)311.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

Influence by rays, and doubling by flight or echo,\n\nare what now give the secret its infinite form, in which perceptions as well\n\nas actions pass into imperceptibility. Paranoid judgment is like an antici-\n\npation of perception replacing empirical research into boxes and their con-\n\ntents: _guilty _a priori, and in any event! (for example, the evolution of the\n\nnarrator of the _Recherche _in relation to Albertine). We can say, in summary\n\nfashion, that psychoanalysis has gone from a hysterical to an increasingly\n\nparanoid conception of the secret.\n\n78\n\nInterminable analysis: the Uncon-\n\nscious has been assigned the increasingly difficult task of itself being the\n\ninfinite form of secrecy, instead of a simple box containing secrets. You will\n\ntell all, but in saying everything you will say nothing because all the \"art\"\nof\n\npsychoanalysis is required in order to measure your contents against the\n\npure form. At this point, however, after the secret has been raised to the\n\nlevel of a form in this way, an inevitable adventure befalls it. When the\n\nquestion \"What happened?\" attains this infinite virile form, the answer is\n\nnecessarily that nothing happened, and both form and content are\n\ndestroyed. The news travels fast that the secret of men is nothing, in truth\n\nnothing at all. Oedipus, the phallus, castration, \"the splinter in the flesh\"\u2014\n\nthat was the secret? It is enough to make women, children, lunatics, and\n\nmolecules laugh.\n\nThe more the secret is made into a structuring, organizing form, the\n\nthinner and more ubiquitous it becomes, the more its content becomes\n\nmolecular, at the same time as its form dissolves. It really wasn't much, as\n\nJocasta says. The secret does not as a result disappear, but it does take on a\n\nmore feminine status. What was behind President Schreber's paranoid\n\nsecret all along, if not a becoming-feminine, a becoming-woman? For\n\nwomen do not handle the secret in at all the same way as men (except when\n\nthey reconstitute an inverted image of virile secrecy, a kind of secrecy of\nthe\n\ngyneceum). Men alternately fault them for their indiscretion, their gossip-\n\ning, and for their solidarity, their betrayal. Yet it is curious how a woman\n\ncan be secretive while at the same time hiding nothing, by virtue of trans-\n\nparency, innocence, and speed. The complex assemblage of secrecy in\n\ncourtly love is properly feminine and operates in the most complete trans-\n\nparency. Celerity against gravity. The celerity of a war machine against the\n\ngravity of a State apparatus. Men adopt a grave attitude, knights of the\n\nsecret: \"You see what burden I bear: my seriousness, my discretion.\" But\n\nthey end up telling everything\u2014and it turns out to be nothing. There are\n\nwomen, on the other hand, who tell everything, sometimes in appalling\n\ntechnical detail, but one knows no more at the end than at the beginning;\n\nthey have hidden everything by celerity, by limpidity.

This is where the secret  \nreaches its ultimate state: its content is molecularized, it has become  \nmolecular, at the same time as its form has been dismantled, becoming a  \npure moving line\u2014in the sense in which it can be said a given line is the  \n\"secret\" of a painter, or a given rhythmic cell, a given sound molecule  \n(which does not constitute a theme or form) the \"secret\" of a musician.\n\nIf ever there was a writer who dealt with the secret, it was Henry James.\n\nIn this respect, he went through an entire evolution, like a perfecting of his  \nart. For he began by looking for the secret in contents, even insignificant,  \nhalf-opened ones, contents briefly glimpsed. Then he raised the possibility  \nof there being an infinite form of secrecy that no longer even requires a con-  \ntent and that has conquered the imperceptible. But he raises this possi-  \nbility only in order to ask the question, Is the secret in the content or in\nthe  \nform? And the answer is already apparent: _neither._\n\n_19_\n\n_ _James is one of those\n\nwriters who is swept up in an irresistible becoming-woman. He never  \nstopped pursuing his goal, inventing the necessary technical means.  \nMo-lecularize the content of the secret and linearize its form. James  \nexplored it all, from the becoming-child of the secret (there is always a  \nchild who discovers secrets: _What Maisie Knew) _to the becoming-woman  \nof the secret (secrecy by a transparency that is no longer anything more  \nthan a pure line that scarcely leaves any traces of its own passage; the  \nadmirable _Daisy Miller). _James is not as close to Proust as people say; it\nis  \nhe who raises the cry, \"Innocent a priori!\" (all Daisy asked for was a little  \nrespect, she would have given her love for that. . .) in opposition to the  \n\"Guilty a priori\" that condemns Albertine. What counts in the secret is  \nless its three states (child's content, virile infinite form, pure feminine  \nline) than the becomings attached to them, the becoming-child of the  \nsecret, its becoming-feminine, its becoming-molecular\u2014which occur  \nprecisely at the point where the secret has lost both its content and its\nform,  \nwhere the imperceptible, the clandestine with nothing left to hide, has  \nfinally been perceived. From the gray eminence to the gray immanence.  \n_Oedipus passes through all three secrets: _the secret of the sphinx whose  \nbox he penetrates; the secret that weighs upon him as the infinite form of  \nhis own guilt; and finally, the secret at Colonus that makes him inaccessible  \nand melds with the pure line of his flight and exile, he who has nothing  \nleft to hide, or, like an old No actor, has only a girl's mask with which to  \ncover his lack of a face. Some people can talk, hide nothing, not lie: they  \nare secret by transparency, as impenetrable as water, in truth  \nincomprehensible.

D 291\n\n_**Memories and Becomings, Points and Blocks. **_Why are there so many\n\nbecomings of man, but no becoming-man? First because man is\n\nmajor-itarian par excellence, whereas becomings are minoritarian; all\n\nbecoming is a becoming-minoritarian. When we say majority, we are\n\nreferring not to a greater relative quantity but to the determination of a\n\nstate or standard in relation to which larger quantities, as well as the\n\nsmallest, can be said to be minoritarian: white-man, adult-male, etc.\n\nMajority implies a state of domination, not the reverse. It is not a question\n\nof knowing whether there are more mosquitoes or flies than men, but of\n\nknowing how \"man\" constituted a standard in the universe in relation to\n\nwhich men necessarily (analytically) form a majority. The majority in a\n\ngovernment presupposes the right to vote, and not only is established\n\namong those who possess that right but is exercised over those who do\n\nnot, however great their numbers; similarly, the majority in the universe\n\nassumes as pregiven the right and power of man.\n\n80\n\nIn this sense women,\n\nchildren, but also animals, plants, and molecules, are minoritarian. It is\n\nperhaps the special situation of women in relation to the man-standard\n\nthat accounts for the fact that becomings, being minoritarian, always pass\n\nthrough a becoming-woman. It is important not to confuse \"minoritarian,\"\n\nas a becoming or process, with a \"minority\", as an aggregate or a state.\n\nJews, Gypsies, etc., may constitute minorities under certain conditions,\n\nbut that in itself does not make them becomings. One reterritorializes, or\n\nallows oneself to be reterritorialized, on a minority as a state; but in a\n\nbecoming, one is deterritorialized. Even blacks, as the Black Panthers\n\nsaid, must become-black. Even women must become-woman. Even Jews\n\nmust become-Jewish (it certainly takes more than a state). But if this is\n\nthe case, then becoming-Jewish necessarily affects the non-Jew as much\n\nas the Jew. Becoming-woman necessary affects men as much as women. In\n\na way, the subject in a becoming is always \"man,\" but only when he\n\nenters a becoming-minoritarian that rends him from his major identity.\n\nAs in Arthur Miller's novel, _Focus, _or Losey's film, _Mr. Klein: _it is the\n\nnon-Jew who becomes Jewish, who is swept up in, carried off by, this\n\nbecoming after being rent from his standard of measure. Conversely, if\n\nJews themselves must become-Jewish, if women must become-woman, if\n\nchildren must become-child, if blacks must become-black, it is because\n\nonly a minority is capable of serving as the active medium of becoming,\n\nbut under such conditions that it ceases to be a definable aggregate in\n\nrelation to the majority. Becoming-Jewish, becoming-woman, etc.,\n\ntherefore imply two simultaneous movements, one by which a term (the\n\nsubject) is withdrawn from the majority, and another by which a term\n\n(the medium or agent) rises up from the minority. There is an\n\nasymmetrical and indissociable block of becoming, a block of alliance: the\n\ntwo \"Mr. Kleins,\"\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)314.png)\n\n0\n\n292 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nthe Jew and the non-Jew, enter into a becoming-Jewish (the same thing\n\nhappens in _Focus)._\n\nA woman has to become-woman, but in a becoming-woman of all man.\n\nA Jew becomes Jewish, but in a becoming-Jewish of the non-Jew. A\n\nbecoming-minoritarian exists only by virtue of a deterritorialized medium\n\nand subject that are like its elements. There is no subject of the becoming\n\nexcept as a deterritorialized variable of the majority; there is no medium of\n\nbecoming except as a deterritorialized variable of a minority. We can be\n\nthrown into a becoming by anything at all, by the most unexpected, most\n\ninsignificant of things. You don't deviate from the majority unless there is\n\na little detail that starts to swell and carries you off. It is because the\nhero of  \n_Focus, _the average American, needs glasses that give his nose a vaguely\n\nSemitic air, it is \"because of the glasses\" that he is thrown into this\nstrange\n\nadventure of the becoming-Jewish of the non-Jew. Anything at all can do\n\nthe job, but it always turns out to be a political affair. Becoming-minori-\n\ntarian is a political affair and necessitates a labor of power _{puissance),\n_an\n\nactive micropolitics. This is the opposite of macropolitics, and even of His-\n\ntory, in which it is a question of knowing how to win or obtain a majority.\n\nAs Faulkner said, to avoid ending up a fascist there was no other choice but\n\nto become-black.\n\n81\n\nUnlike history, becoming cannot be conceptualized in\n\nterms of past and future. Becoming-revolutionary remains indifferent to\n\nquestions of a future and a past of the revolution; it passes between the two.\n\nEvery becoming is a block of coexistence. The so-called ahistorical socie-\n\nties set themselves outside history, not because they are content to repro-\n\nduce immutable models or are governed by a fixed structure, but because\n\nthey are societies of becoming (war societies, secret societies, etc.). There\nis\n\nno history but of the majority, or of minorities as defined in relation to the\n\nmajority. And yet \"how to win the majority\" is a totally secondary problem\n\nin relation to the advances of the imperceptible.\n\nLet us try to say it another way: There is no becoming-man because man\n\nis the molar entity par excellence, whereas becomings are molecular. The\n\nfaciality function showed us the form under which man constitutes the\n\nmajority, or rather the standard upon which the majority is based: white,\n\nmale, adult, \"rational,\" etc., in short, the average European, the subject of\n\nenunciation. Following the law of arborescence, it is this central Point that\n\nmoves across all of space or the entire screen, and at every turn nourishes a\n\ncertain distinctive opposition, depending on which faciality trait is\n\nretained: male-(female), adult-(child), white-(black, yellow, or red);\n\nrational-(animal). The central point, or third eye, thus has the property of\n\norganizing binary distributions within the dualism machines, and of\n\nreproducing itself in the principal term of the opposition; the entire oppo-\n\nsition at the same time resonates in the central point. The constitution of a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)315.png)\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 293\n\n\"majority\" as redundancy. Man constitutes himself as a gigantic memory,\n\nthrough the position of the central point, its frequency (insofar as it is\nnec-\n\nessarily reproduced by each dominant point), and its resonance (insofar as\n\nall of the points tie in with it). Any line that goes from one point to\nanother\n\nin the aggregate of the molar system, and is thus defined by points answer-\n\ning to these mnemonic conditions of frequency and resonance, is a part of\n\nthe arborescent system.\n\n82\n\nWhat constitutes arborescence is the submission of the line to the point.\n\nOf course, the child, the woman, the black have memories; but the Memory\n\nthat collects those memories is still a virile majoritarian agency treating\n\nthem as \"childhood memories,\" as conjugal, or colonial memories. It is\n\npossible to operate by establishing a conjunction or collocation of contigu-\n\nous points rather than a relation between distant points: you would then\n\nhave phantasies rather than memories. For example, a woman can have a\n\nfemale point alongside a male point, and a man a male point alongside a\n\nfemale one. The constitution of these hybrids, however, does not take us\n\nvery far in the direction of a true becoming (for example, bisexuality, as the\n\npsychoanalysts note, in no way precludes the prevalence of the masculine\n\nor the majority of the \"phallus\"). One does not break with the arborescent\n\nschema, one does not reach becoming or the molecular, as long as a line is\n\nconnected to two distant points, or is composed of two contiguous points.\n\nA line of becoming is not defined by points that it connects, or by points\n\nthat compose it; on the contrary, it passes _between _points, it comes up\n\nthrough the middle, it runs perpendicular to the points first perceived,\n\ntransversally to the localizable relation to distant or contiguous points.\n\n83\n\nA\n\npoint is always a point of origin. But a line of becoming has neither begin-\n\nning nor end, departure nor arrival, origin nor destination; to speak of the\n\nabsence of an origin, to make the absence of an origin the origin, is a bad\n\nplay on words. A line of becoming has only a middle. The middle is not an\n\naverage; it is fast motion, it is the absolute speed of movement. A becoming\n\nis always in the middle; one can only get it by the middle. A becoming is nei-\n\nther one nor two, nor the relation of the two; it is the in-between, the\nborder\n\nor line of flight or descent running perpendicular to both. If becoming is a\n\nblock (a line-block), it is because it constitutes a zone of proximity and\n\nindiscernibility, a no-man's-land, a nonlocalizable relation sweeping up\n\nthe two distant or contiguous points, carrying one into the proximity of the\n\nother\u2014and the border-proximity is indifferent to both contiguity and to\n\ndistance. The line or block of becoming that unites the wasp and the orchid\n\nproduces a shared deterritorialization: of the wasp, in that it becomes a lib-\n\nerated piece of the orchid's reproductive system, but also of the orchid, in\n\nthat it becomes the object of an orgasm in the wasp, also liberated from its\n\nown reproduction. A coexistence of two asymmetrical movements that\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)316.png)\n\n0\n\n294 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\ncombine to form a block, down a line of flight that sweeps away selective\n\npressures. The line, or the block, does not link the wasp to the orchid, any\n\nmore than it conjugates or mixes them: it passes between them, carrying\n\nthem away in a shared proximity in which the discernibility of points dis-\n\nappears. The line-system (or block-system) of becoming is opposed to the\n\npoint-system of memory. Becoming is the movement by which the line\n\nfrees itself from the point, and renders points indiscernible: the rhizome,\n\nthe opposite of arborescence; break away from arborescence. _Becoming is  \nan antimemory. _Doubtless, there exists a molecular memory, but as a fac-\n\ntor of integration into a majoritarian or molar system. Memories always\n\nhave a reterritorialization function. On the other hand, a vector of\n\ndeterritorialization is in no way indeterminate; it is directly plugged into\n\nthe molecular levels, and the more deterritorialized it is, the stronger is\nthe\n\ncontact: it is deterritorialization that makes the aggregate of the molecular\n\ncomponents \"hold together.\" From this point of view, one may contrast a  \n_childhood block, _or a becoming-child, with the _childhood memory: _\"a\"\n\nmolecular child is produced. . . \"a\" child coexists with us, in a zone of\nprox-\n\nimity or a block of becoming, on a line of deterritorialization that carries\nus\n\nboth off\u2014as opposed to the child we once were, whom we remember or\n\nphantasize, the molar child whose future is the adult. \"This will be child-\n\nhood, but it must not be my childhood,\" writes Virginia Woolf. _{Orlando _\n\nalready does not operate by memories, but by blocks, blocks of ages, block\n\nof epochs, blocks of the kingdoms of nature, blocks of sexes, forming so\n\nmany becomings between things, or so many lines of deterritoriali-\n\nzation.)\n\n84\n\nWherever we used the word \"memories\" in the preceding pages,\n\nwe were wrong to do so; we meant to say \"becoming,\" we were saying\n\nbecoming.\n\nIf the line is opposed to the point (or blocks to memories, becoming to\n\nthe faculty of memory), it is not in an absolute way: a punctual system\n\nincludes a certain utilization of lines, and the block itself assigns the\npoint\n\nnew functions. In a punctual system, a point basically refers to linear coor-\n\ndinates. Not only are a horizontal line and a vertical line represented, but\n\nthe vertical moves parallel to itself, and the horizontal superposes other\n\nhorizontals upon itself; every point is assigned in relation to the two base\n\ncoordinates, but is also marked on a horizontal line of superposition and\n\non a vertical line or plane of displacement. Finally, two points are con-\n\nnected when any line is drawn from one to the other. _A system is termed  \npunctual_'when its lines are taken as coordinates in this way, or as\nlocalizable\n\nconnections; for example, systems of arborescence, or molar and mne-\n\nmonic systems in general, are punctual. Memory has a punctual organiza-\n\ntion because every present refers simultaneously to the horizontal line of  \n_the flow _of time (kinematics), which goes from an old present to the actual\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)317.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 295\n\npresent, and the vertical line of the _order _of time (stratigraphy), which\ngoes\n\nfrom the present to the past, or to the representation of the old present.\n\nThis is, of course, a basic schema that cannot be developed further without\n\nrunning into major complications, but it is the one found in representa-\n\ntions of art forming a \"didactic\" system, in other words, a mnemotechnics.\n\nMusical representation, on the one hand, draws a horizontal, melodic line,\n\nthe bass line, upon which other melodic lines are superposed; points are\n\nassigned that enter into relations of counterpoint between lines. On the\n\nother hand, it draws a vertical, harmonic line or plane, which moves along\n\nthe horizontals but is no longer dependent upon them; it runs from high to\n\nlow and defines a chord capable of linking up with the following chords.\n\nPictorial representation has an analogous form, with means of its own: this\n\nis not only because the painting has a vertical and a horizontal, but because\n\nthe traits and colors, each on its own account, relate to verticals of\ndisplace-\n\nment and horizontals of superposition (for example, the vertical cold form,\n\nor white, light and tonality; the horizontal warm form, or black, chromatics\n\nand modality, etc.). To cite only relatively recent examples, this is evident\n\nin the didactic systems of Kandinsky, Klee, and Mondrian, which neces-\n\nsarily imply an encounter with music.\n\nLet us summarize the principal characteristics of a punctual system: (1)\n\nSystems of this kind comprise two base lines, horizontal and vertical; they\n\nserve as coordinates for assigning points. (2) The horizontal line can be\n\nsuperposed vertically and the vertical line can be moved horizontally, in\n\nsuch a way that new points are produced or reproduced, under conditions\n\nof horizontal frequency and vertical resonance. (3) From one point to\n\nanother, a line can (or cannot) be drawn, but if it can it takes the form of a\n\nlocalizable connection; diagonals thus play the role of connectors between\n\npoints of different levels or moments, instituting in their turn frequencies\n\nand resonances on the basis of these points of variable horizon or verticon,\n\ncontiguous or distant.\n\n85\n\nThese systems are arborescent, mnemonic, molar,\n\nstructural; they are systems of territorialization or reterritorialization.\nThe\n\nline and the diagonal remain totally subordinated to the point because they\n\nserve as coordinates for a point or as localizable connections for two\n\npoints, running from one point to another.\n\nOpposed to the punctual system are linear, or rather multilinear, sys-\n\ntems. Free the line, free the diagonal: every musician or painter has this\n\nintention. One elaborates a punctual system or a didactic representation,\n\nbut with the aim of making it snap, of sending a tremor through it. A punc-\n\ntual system is most interesting when there is a musician, painter, writer,\n\nphilosopher to oppose it, who even fabricates it in order to oppose it, like a\n\nspringboard to jump from. History is made only by those who oppose his-\n\ntory (not by those who insert themselves into it, or even reshape it).

When this is done it always goes\n\ndown in History but never comes from it. History may try to break its ties\n\nto memory; it may make the schemas of memory more elaborate, super-\n\npose and shift coordinates, emphasize connections, or deepen breaks. The\n\ndividing line, however, is not there. The dividing line passes not between\n\nhistory and memory but between punctual \"history-memory\" systems and\n\ndiagonal or multilinear assemblages, which are in no way eternal: they have\n\nto do with becoming; they are a bit of becoming in the pure state; they are\n\ntranshistorical. There is no act of creation that is not transhistorical and\n\ndoes not come up from behind or proceed by way of a liberated line.\n\nNietzsche opposes history not to the eternal but to the subhistorical or\n\nsuperhistorical: the Untimely, which is another name for haecceity,\n\nbecoming, the innocence of becoming (in other words, forgetting as\n\nopposed to memory, geography as opposed to history, the map as opposed\n\nto the tracing, the rhizome as opposed to arborescence). \"The unhistorical\n\nis like an atmosphere within which alone life can germinate and with the\n\ndestruction of which it must vanish. . . . What deed would man be capable\n\nof if he had not first entered into that vaporous region of the unhis-\n\ntorical?\"\n\n86\n\nCreations are like mutant abstract lines that have detached\n\nthemselves from the task of representing a world, precisely because they\n\nassemble a new type of reality that history can only recontain or relocate in\n\npunctual systems.\n\nWhen Boulez casts himself in the role of historian of music, he does so in\n\norder to show how a great musician, in a very different manner in each case,\n\ninvents a kind of diagonal running between the harmonic vertical and the\n\nmelodic horizon. And in each case it is a different diagonal, a different\n\ntechnique, a creation. Moving along this transversal line, which is really a\n\nline of deterritorialization, there is a _sound block _that no longer has a\npoint\n\nof origin, since it is always and already in the middle of the line; and no\n\nlonger has horizontal and vertical coordinates, since it creates its own coor-\n\ndinates; and no longer forms a localizable connection from one point to\n\nanother, since it is in \"nonpulsed time\": a deterritorialized rhythmic block\n\nthat has abandoned points, coordinates, and measure, like a drunken boat\n\nthat melds with the line or draws a plane of consistency. Speeds and\n\nslownesses inject themselves into musical form, sometimes impelling it to\n\nproliferation, linear microproliferations, and sometimes to extinction,\n\nsonorous abolition, involution, or both at once. The musician is in the best\n\nposition to say: \"I hate the faculty of memory, I hate memories.\" And that is\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)319.png)\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 297\n\nbecause he or she affirms the power of becoming. The Viennese school is\n\nexemplary of this kind of diagonal, this kind of line-block. But it can\n\nequally be said that the Viennese school found a new system of\n\nterrito-rialization, of points, verticals, and horizontals that position it in\n\nHistory. Another attempt, another creative act, came after it. The\n\nimportant thing is that all musicians have always proceeded in this way:\n\ndrawing their own diagonal, however fragile, outside points, outside\n\ncoordinates and localizable connections, in order to float a sound block\n\ndown a created, liberated line, in order to unleash in space this mobile\n\nand mutant sound block, a haecceity (for example, chromaticism,\n\naggregates, and complex notes, but already the resources and possibilities\n\nof polyphony, etc.).\n\n87\n\nSome have spoken of \"oblique vectors\" with respect\n\nto the organ. The diagonal is often composed of extremely complex lines\n\nand spaces of sound. Is that the secret of a little phrase or a rhythmic\n\nblock? Undoubtedly, the point now assumes a new and essential creative\n\nfunction. It is no longer simply a question of an inevitable destiny\n\nreconstituting a punctual system; on the contrary, it is now the point that\n\nis subordinated to the line, the point now marks the proliferation of the\n\nline, or its sudden deviation, its acceleration, its slowdown, its furor or\n\nagony. Mozart's \"microblocks.\" The block may even be reduced to a point,\n\nas though to a single note (point-block): Berg's B in _Wozzeck, _Schumann's\n\nA. Homage to Schumann, the madness of Schumann: the cello wanders\n\nacross the grid of the orchestration, drawing its diagonal, along which the\n\ndeterritorialized sound block moves; or an extremely sober kind of refrain\n\nis \"treated\" by a very elaborate melodic line and polyphonic architecture.\n\nIn a multilinear system, everything happens at once: the line breaks free\n\nof the point as origin; the diagonal breaks free of the vertical and the hori-\n\nzontal as coordinates; and the transversal breaks free of the diagonal as a\n\nlocalizable connection between two points.

In effect,\n\nthe point does not make the line; the line sweeps away the deterritorialized  \npoint, carries it off under its outside influence; the line does not go from  \none point to another, but runs _between points _in a different direction that  \nrenders them indiscernible. The line has become the diagonal, which has  \nbroken free from the vertical and the horizontal. But the diagonal has  \nalready become the transversal, the semidiagonal or free straight line, the  \nbroken or angular line, or the curve\u2014always in the midst of themselves.  \nBetween the white vertical and the black horizontal lie Klee's gray,  \nKandinsky's red, Monet's purple; each forms a block of color. This line is  \nwithout origin, since it always begins off the painting, which only holds it  \nby the middle; it is without coordinates, because it melds with a plane of  \nconsistency upon which it floats and that it creates; it is without\nlocalizable  \nconnection, because it has lost not only its representative function but any  \nfunction of outlining a form of any kind\u2014by this token, the line has  \nbecome abstract, truly abstract and mutant, a visual block; and under these  \nconditions the point assumes creative functions again, as a color-point or  \nline-point.\n\n89\n\nThe line is between points, in their midst, and no longer goes\n\nfrom one point to another. It does not outline a shape. \"He did not paint  \nthings, he painted between things.\" There is no falser problem in painting  \nthan depth and, in particular, perspective. For perspective is only a histori-  \ncal manner _of occupying _diagonals or transversals, lines of flight _[lignes\nde  \nfuite: _here, the lines in a painting moving toward the vanishing point, or  \n_point de fuite_\u2014Trans.], in other words, of reterritorializing the moving\nvis-  \nual block. We use the word \"occupy\" in the sense of \"giving an occupation  \nto,\" fixing a memory and a code, assigning a function. But the lines of  \nflight, the transversals, are suitable for many other functions besides this  \nmolar function. Lines of flight as perspective lines, far from being made to  \nrepresent depth, themselves invent the possibility of such a representation,  \nwhich occupies them only for an instant, at a given moment. Perspective,  \nand even depth, are the reterritorialization of lines of flight, which alone  \ncreated painting by carrying it farther. What is called central perspective in  \nparticular plunged the multiplicity of escapes and the dynamism of lines  \ninto a punctual black hole. Conversely, it is true that problems of perspec-  \ntive triggered a whole profusion of creative lines, a mass release of visual  \nblocks, at the very moment they claimed to have gained mastery over them.  \nIs painting, in each of its acts of creation, engaged in a becoming as intense  \nas that of music?\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)321.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 299\n\n_Becoming-Music. _We have tried to define in the case of Western music\n\n(although the other musical traditions confront an analogous problem,\n\nunder different conditions, to which they find different solutions) a block\n\nof becoming at the level of expression, or a block of expression: this block\nof\n\nbecoming rests on transversals that continually escape from the coordi-\n\nnates or punctual systems functioning as musical codes at a given moment.\n\nIt is obvious that there is a block of content corresponding to this block of\n\nexpression. It is not really a correspondence; there would be no mobile\n\n\"block\" if a content, itself musical (and not a subject or a theme), were not\n\nalways interfering with the expression. What does music deal with, what is\n\nthe content indissociable from sound expression? It is hard to say, but it is\n\nsomething: _a _child dies, a child plays, a woman is born, a woman dies, a\n\nbird arrives, a bird flies off. We wish to say that these are not accidental\n\nthemes in music (even if it is possible to multiply examples), much less imi-\n\ntative exercises; they are something essential. Why a child, a woman, a\n\nbird? It is because musical expression is inseparable from a\n\nbecoming-woman, a becoming-child, a becoming-animal that constitute\n\nits content. Why does the child die, or the bird fall as though pierced by\n\nan arrow? Because of the \"danger\" inherent in any line that escapes, in\n\nany line of flight or creative deterritorialization: the danger of veering\n\ntoward destruction, toward abolition. Melisande [in Debussy's opera,  \n_Pelleas et Melisande_\u2014Trans.], a child-woman, a secret, dies twice (\"it's\n\nthe poor little dear's turn now\"). Music is never tragic, music is joy. But\n\nthere are times it necessarily gives us a taste for death; not so much\n\nhappiness as dying happily, being extinguished. Not as a function of a\n\ndeath instinct it allegedly awakens in us, but of a dimension proper to its\n\nsound assemblage, to its sound machine, the moment that must be\n\nconfronted, the moment the transversal turns into a line of abolition. Peace  \n_and _exasperation.\n\n90\n\nMusic has a thirst for destruction, every kind of\n\ndestruction, extinction, breakage, dislocation. Is that not its potential\n\n\"fascism\"? Whenever a musician writes _In Memoriam, _it is not so much a\n\nquestion of an inspirational motif or a memory, but on the contrary of a\n\nbecoming that is only confronting its own danger, even taking a fall in\n\norder to rise again: a becoming-child, a becoming-woman, a\n\nbecoming-animal, insofar as they are the content of music itself and\n\ncontinue to the point of death.\n\nWe would say that the _refrain _is properly musical content, the block of\n\ncontent proper to music. A child comforts itself in the dark or claps its\n\nhands or invents a way of walking, adapting it to the cracks in the sidewalk,\n\nor chants \"Fort-Da\" (psychoanalysts deal with the Fort-Da very poorly\n\nwhen they treat it as a phonological opposition or a symbolic component of\n\nthe language-unconscious, when it is in fact a refrain).

All of music is pervaded by bird\n\nsongs, in a thousand different ways, from Jannequin to Messiaen. Frr, Frr.\n\nMusic is pervaded by childhood blocks, by blocks of femininity. Music is\n\npervaded by every minority, and yet composes an immense power. Chil-\n\ndren's, women's, ethnic, and territorial refrains, refrains of love and\n\ndestruction: the birth of rhythm. Schumann's work is made of refrains, of\n\nchildhood blocks, which he treats in a very special way: his own kind of\n\nbecoming-child, his own kind of becoming-woman, Clara. It would be pos-\n\nsible to catalogue the transversal or diagonal utilizations of the refrain in\n\nthe history of music, all of the children's Games and _Kinderszenen, _all of\n\nthe bird songs. But such a catalogue would be useless because it would seem\n\nlike a multiplication of examples of themes, subjects, and motifs, when it is\n\nin fact a question of the most essential and necessary content of music. The\n\nmotif of the refrain may be anxiety, fear, joy, love, work, walking, territory\n\n. . . but the refrain itself is the content of music.\n\nWe are not at all saying that the refrain is the origin of music, or that\n\nmusic begins with it. It is not really known when music begins. The refrain\n\nis rather a means of preventing music, warding it off, or forgoing it. But\n\nmusic exists because the refrain exists also, because music takes up the\n\nrefrain, lays hold of it as a content in a form of expression, because it\nforms\n\na block with it in order to take it somewhere else. _The child's refrain,\nwhich  \nis not music, forms a block with the becoming-child of music: _once again,\n\nthis asymmetrical composition is necessary. \"Ah, vous dirai-je maman\"\n\n(\"Ah, mamma, now you shall know\") in Mozart, Mozart's refrains. A\n\ntheme in C, followed by twelve variations; not only is each note of the\n\ntheme doubled, but the theme is doubled internally. Music submits the\n\nrefrain to this very special treatment of the diagonal or transversal, it\n\nuproots the refrain from its territoriality. Music is a creative, active\nopera-\n\ntion that consists in deterritorializing the refrain. Whereas the refrain is\n\nessentially territorial, territorializing, or reterritorializing, music makes\nit\n\na deterritorialized content for a deterritorializing form of expression. Par-\n\ndon that sentence: what musicians do should be musical, it should be writ-\n\nten in music. Instead, we will give a figurative example: Mussorgsky's\n\n\"Lullaby,\" in _Songs and Dances of Death, _presents an exhausted mother sit-\n\nting up with her sick child; she is relieved by a visitor, Death, who sings a\n\nlullaby in which each couplet ends with an obsessive, sober refrain, a repet-\n\nitive rhythm with only one note, a point-block: \"Shush, little child, sleep\n\nmy little child\" (not only does the child die, but the deterritorialization of\n\nthe refrain is doubled by Death in person, who replaces the mother).\n\nIs the situation similar for painting, and if so, how? In no way do we\n\nbelieve in a fine-arts system; we believe in very diverse problems whose\n\nsolutions are found in heterogeneous arts. To us, Art is a false concept, a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)323.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ... D 301\n\nsolely nominal concept; this does not, however, preclude the possibility of a\n\nsimultaneous usage of the various arts within a determinable multiplicity.\n\nThe \"problem\" within which painting is inscribed is that of the  \n_face-landscape. _That of music is entirely different: it is the problem of\n\nthe _refrain. _Each arises at a certain moment, under certain conditions, on\n\nthe line of its problem; but there is no possible structural or symbolic\n\ncorrespondence between the two, unless one translates them into punctual\n\nsystems. We have distinguished the following three states of the\n\nlandscape problem: (1) semiotic systems of corporeality, silhouettes,\n\npostures, colors, and lines (these semiotic systems are already present in\n\nprofusion among animals; the head is part of the body, and the body has\n\nthe milieu, the biotope as its correlate; these systems already display very\n\npure lines as, for example, in the \"grass stem\" behavior); (2) an\n\norganization of the face, white wall/black holes, face/eyes, or facial\n\nprofile/sideview of the eyes (this semiotic system of faciality has the\n\nlandscape as its correlate: facialization of the entire body and\n\nlandscapification of all the milieus, Christ as the European central point);\n\n(3) a deterritorialization of faces and landscapes, in favor of probe-heads\n\nwhose lines no longer outline a form or form a contour, and whose colors\n\nno longer lay out a landscape (this is the pictorial semiotic system: Put\n\nthe face and the landscape to flight. For example, what Mondrian\n\ncorrectly calls a \"landscape\": a pure, absolutely deterrito-rialized\n\nlandscape).\n\nFor convenience, we presented three successive and distinct states, but\n\nonly provisionally. We cannot decide whether animals have painting, even\n\nthough they do not paint on canvas, and even when hormones induce their\n\ncolors and lines; even here, there is little foundation for a clear-cut\ndistinc-\n\ntion between animals and human beings. Conversely, we must say that\n\npainting does not begin with so-called abstract art but recreates the silhou-\n\nettes and postures of corporeality, and is already fully in operation in the\n\nface-landscape organization (the way in which painters \"work\" the face of\n\nChrist, and make it leak from the religious code in all directions). The aim\n\nof painting has always been the deterritorialization of faces and land-\n\nscapes, either by a reactivation of corporeality, or by a liberation of lines\nor\n\ncolors, or both at the same time. There are many becomings-animal,\n\nbecomings-woman, and becomings-child in painting.\n\nThe problem of music is different, if it is true that its problem is the\n\nrefrain. Deterritorializing the refrain, inventing lines of deterritorializa-\n\ntion for the refrain, implies procedures and constructions that have noth-\n\ning to do with those of painting (outside of vague analogies of the sort\n\npainters have often tried to establish). Again, it is not certain whether we\n\ncan draw a dividing line between animals and human beings: Are there not,\n\nas Messiaen believes, musician birds and nonmusician birds? Is the bird's\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)324.png)\n\n0\n\n302 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...\n\nrefrain necessarily territorial, or is it not already used for very subtle\n\ndeterritorializations, for selective lines of flight? The difference between\n\nnoise and sound is definitely not a basis for a definition of music, or even\n\nfor the distinction between musician birds and nonmusician birds. Rather,\n\nit is the _labor of the refrain: _Does it remain territorial and\nterritorializing,\n\nor is it carried away in a moving block that draws a transversal across all\n\ncoordinates\u2014and all of the intermediaries between the two? Music is pre-\n\ncisely the adventure of the refrain: the way music lapses back into a refrain\n\n(in our head, in Swann's head, in the pseudo-probe-heads on TV and radio,\n\nthe music of a great musician used as a signature tune, a ditty); the way it\n\nlays hold of the refrain, makes it more and more sober, reduced to a few\n\nnotes, then takes it down a creative line that is so much richer, no origin or\n\nend of which is in sight. ..\n\nLeroi-Gourhan established a distinction and correlation between two\n\npoles, \"hand-tool\" and \"face-language.\" But there it was a question of dis-\n\ntinguishing a form of content and a form of expression. Here we are consid-\n\nering expressions that hold their content within themselves, so we must\n\nmake a different distinction: the face with its visual correlates (eyes) con-\n\ncerns painting; the voice with its auditory correlates (the ear is itself a\n\nrefrain, it is shaped like one) concerns music. Music is a\n\ndeterrito-rialization of the voice, which becomes less and less tied to\n\nlanguage, just as painting is a deterritorialization of the face. Traits of\n\nvocability can indeed be indexed to traits of faciality, as in lipreading;\nthey\n\nare not, however, in correspondence, especially when they are carried off\n\nby the respective movements of music and painting. The voice is far ahead\n\nof the face, very far ahead. Entitling a musical work _Visage _(Face) thus\n\nseems to be the greatest of sound paradoxes.\n\n91\n\nThe only way to \"line up\"\n\nthe two problems of painting and music is to take a criterion extrinsic to the\n\nfiction of the fine arts, to compare the forces of deterritorialization in\neach\n\ncase. Music seems to have a much stronger deterritorializing force, at once\n\nmore intense and much more collective, and the voice seems to have a much\n\ngreater power of deterritorialization. Perhaps this trait explains the\n\ncollective fascination exerted by music, and even the potentiality of the\n\n\"fascist\" danger we mentioned a little earlier: music (drums, trumpets)\n\ndraws people and armies into a race that can go all the way to the abyss\n\n(much more so than banners and flags, which are paintings, means of\n\nclassification and rallying). It may be that musicians are individually more\n\nreactionary than painters, more religious, less \"social\"; they nevertheless\n\nwield a collective force infinitely greater than that of painting: \"The\n\nchorus formed by the assembly of the people is a very powerful bond...\"\n\nIt is always possible to explain this force by the material conditions of\n\nmusical emission and reception, but it is preferable to take the reverse\n\napproach; these conditions are explained\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)325.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 303\n\nby the force of deterritorialization of music. It could be said that from the\n\nstandpoint of the mutant abstract machine painting and music do not cor-\n\nrespond to the same thresholds, or that the pictorial machine and the musi-\n\ncal machine do not have the same index. There is a \"backwardness\" of\n\npainting in relation to music, as Klee, the most musicianly of painters,\n\nobserved.\n\n92\n\nMaybe that is why many people prefer painting, or why aes-\n\nthetics took painting as its privileged model: there is no question that it\n\n\"scares\" people less. Even its relations to capitalism and social formations\n\nare not at all of the same type.\n\nDoubtless, in each case we must simultaneously consider factors of\n\nterritoriality, deterritorialization, and reterritorialization. Animal and\n\nchild refrains seem to be territorial: therefore they are not \"music.\" But\n\nwhen music lays hold of the refrain and deterritorializes it, and\n\ndeterrito-rializes the voice, when it lays hold of the refrain and sends it\n\nracing off in a rhythmic sound block, when the refrain \"becomes\"\n\nSchumann or Debussy, it is through a system of melodic and harmonic\n\ncoordinates by means of which music reterritorializes upon itself, _qua _\n\nmusic. Conversely, we shall see that in certain cases even the animal refrain\n\npossesses forces of deterritorialization much more intense than animal\n\nsilhouettes, postures, and colors. We must therefore take a number of\n\nfactors into consideration: relative territorialities, their respective\n\ndeterritorializations, and their correlative reterritorializations, several\n\ntypes of them (for example, intrinsic reterritorializations such as musical\n\ncoordinates, and extrinsic ones such as the deterioration of the refrain\n\ninto a hackneyed formula, or music into a ditty). The fact that there is no\n\ndeterritorialization without a special reterritorialization should prompt us\n\nto rethink the abiding correlation between the molar and the molecular:\n\nno flow, no becoming-molecular escapes from a molar formation without\n\nmolar components accompanying it, forming passages or perceptible\n\nlandmarks for the imperceptible processes.\n\nThe becoming-woman, the becoming-child of music are present in the\n\nproblem of the machining of the voice. Machining the voice was the first\n\nmusical operation. As we know, the problem was resolved in Western\n\nmusic in two different ways, in Italy and in England: the head voice of the\n\ncountertenor, who sings \"above his voice,\" or whose voice operates inside\n\nthe sinuses and at the back of the throat and the palate without relying on\n\nthe diaphragm or passing through the bronchial tubes; and the stomach\n\nvoice of the castrati, \"stronger, more voluminous, more languid,\" as if\n\nthey gave carnal matter to the imperceptible, impalpable, and aerial.\n\nDominique Fernandez wrote a fine book on this subject; he shows, fortu-\n\nnately refraining from any psychoanalytic discussion of a link between\n\nmusic and castration, that the musical problem of the machinery of the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)326.png)\n\n0\n\n304 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...\n\nvoice necessarily implies the abolition of the overall dualism machine, in\n\nother words, the molar formation assigning voices to the \"man or\n\nwoman.\"\n\n93\n\nBeing a man _or _a woman no longer exists in music. It is not cer-\n\ntain, however, that the myth of the androgyne Fernandez invokes is ade-\n\nquate. It is a question not of myth but of real becoming. The voice itself\n\nmust attain a becoming-woman or a becoming-child. That is the prodi-\n\ngious content of music. It is no longer a question, as Fernandez observes, of\n\nimitating a woman or a child, even if it is a child who is singing. The musi-\n\ncal voice itself becomes-child at the same time as the child\n\nbecomes-sonorous, purely sonorous. No child could ever have done that,\n\nor if one did, it would be by becoming in addition something other than a\n\nchild, a child belonging to a different, strangely sensual and celestial,\n\nworld. In short, the deterritorialization is double: the voice is\n\ndeterritorialized in a becoming-child, but the child it becomes is itself\n\ndeterritorialized, unen-gendered, becoming. \"The child grew wings,\" said\n\nSchumann. We find the same zigzag movement in the becomings-animal\n\nof music: Marcel More shows that the music of Mozart is permeated by a\n\nbecoming-horse, or becomings-bird. But no musician amuses himself by\n\n\"playing\" horse or bird. If the sound block has a becoming-animal as its\n\ncontent, then the animal simultaneously becomes, in sonority, something\n\nelse, something absolute, night, death, joy\u2014certainly not a generality or a\n\nsimplification, but a haecceity, this death, that night. Music takes as its\n\ncontent a becoming-animal; but in that becoming-animal the horse, for\n\nexample, takes as its expression soft kettledrum beats, winged like hooves\n\nfrom heaven or hell; and the birds find expression in _gruppeti, _\n\nappoggiaturas, staccato notes that transform them into so many souls.\n\n94\n\nIt\n\nis the accents that form the diagonal in Mozart, the accents above all. If\n\none does not follow the accents, if one does not observe them, one falls\n\nback into a relatively impoverished punctual system. The human\n\nmusician is deterritorialized in the bird, but it is a bird that is itself\n\ndeterritorialized, \"transfigured,\" a celestial bird that has just as much of a\n\nbecoming as that which becomes with it. Captain Ahab is engaged in an\n\nirresistible becoming-whale with Moby-Dick; but the animal,\n\nMoby-Dick, must simultaneously become an unbearable pure whiteness,\n\na shimmering pure white wall, a silver thread that stretches out and supples\n\nup \"like\" a girl, or twists like a whip, or stands like a rampart. Can it be\nthat\n\nliterature sometimes catches up with painting, and even music? And that\n\npainting catches up with music? (More cites Klee's birds but on the other\n\nhand fails to understand what Messiaen says about bird song.) No art is\n\nimitative, no art can be imitative or figurative. Suppose a painter\n\n\"represents\" a bird; this is in fact a becoming-bird that can occur only to\n\nthe extent that the bird itself is in the process of becoming something else,\na\n\npure line and pure color. Thus imitation self-destructs,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)327.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL... D 305\n\nsince the imitator unknowingly enters into a becoming that conjugates\n\nwith the unknowing becoming of that which he or she imitates. One imi-\n\ntates only if one fails, when one fails. The painter and musician do not imi-\n\ntate the animal, they become-animal at the same time as the animal\n\nbecomes what they willed, at the deepest level of their concord with\n\nNature.\n\n95\n\nBecoming is always double, that which one becomes becomes no\n\nless than the one that becomes\u2014block is formed, essentially mobile, never\n\nin equilibrium. Mondrian's is the perfect square. It balances on one corner\n\nand produces a diagonal that half-opens its closure, carrying away both\n\nsides.\n\nBecoming is never imitating. When Hitchcock does birds, he does not\n\nreproduce bird calls, he produces an electronic sound like a field of intensi-\n\nties or a wave of vibrations, a continuous variation, like a terrible threat\n\nwelling up inside us.\n\n96\n\nAnd this applies not only to the \"arts\": _Moby-Dick^ _\n\neffect also hinges the pure lived experience of double becoming, and the\n\nbook would not have the same beauty otherwise. The tarantella is a strange\n\ndance that magically cures or exorcises the supposed victims of a tarantula\n\nbite. But when the victim does this dance, can he or she be said to be imitat-\n\ning the spider, to be identifying with it, even in an identification through\nan\n\n\"archetypal\" or \"agonistic\" struggle? No, because the victim, the patient,\n\nthe person who is sick, becomes a dancing spider only to the extent that the\n\nspider itself is supposed to become a pure silhouette, pure color and pure\n\nsound to which the person dances.\n\n97\n\nOne does not imitate; one constitutes\n\na block of becoming. Imitation enters in only as an adjustment of the block,\n\nlike a finishing touch, a wink, a signature. But everything of importance\n\nhappens elsewhere: in the becoming-spider of the dance, which occurs on\n\nthe condition that the spider itself becomes sound and color, orchestra and\n\npainting. Take the case of the local folk hero, Alexis the Trotter, who ran\n\n\"like\" a horse at extraordinary speed, whipped himself with a short switch,\n\nwhinnied, reared, kicked, knelt, lay down on the ground in the manner of a\n\nhorse, competed against them in races, and against bicycles and trains. He\n\nimitated a horse to make people laugh. But he had a deeper zone of proxim-\n\nity or indiscernibility. Sources tell us that he was never as much of a horse\n\nas when he played the harmonica: precisely because he no longer needed a\n\nregulating or secondary imitation. It is said that he called his harmonica his\n\n\"chops-destroyer\" and played the instrument twice as fast as anyone else,\n\ndoubled the beat, imposed a nonhuman tempo.\n\n98\n\nAlexis became all the\n\nmore horse when the horse's bit became a harmonica, and the horse's trot\n\nwent into double time. As always, the same must be said of the animals\n\nthemselves. For not only do animals have colors and sounds, but they do\n\nnot wait for the painter or musician to use those colors and sounds in a\n\npainting or music, in other words, to enter into determinate becomings-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)328.png)\n\n0\n\n306 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...\n\ncolor and becomings-sounds by means of components of\n\ndeterrito-rialization (we will return to this point later). Ethology is\n\nadvanced enough to have entered this realm.\n\nWe are not at all arguing for an aesthetics of qualities, as if the pure\n\nquality (color, sound, etc.) held the secret of a becoming without measure,\n\nas in _Philebus. _Pure qualities still seem to us to be punctual systems: They\n\nare reminiscences, they are either transcendent or floating memories or\n\nseeds of phantasy. A functionalist conception, on the other hand, only\n\nconsiders the function a quality fulfills in a specific assemblage, or in\n\npassing from one assemblage to another. The quality must be considered\n\nfrom the standpoint of the becoming that grasps it, instead of becoming\n\nbeing considered from the standpoint of intrinsic qualities having the\n\nvalue of archetypes or phylogenetic memories. For example, whiteness,\n\ncolor, is gripped in a becoming-animal that can be that of the painter or of\n\nCaptain Ahab, and at the same time in a becoming-color, a\n\nbecoming-whiteness, that can be that of the animal itself. Moby-Dick's\n\nwhiteness is the special index of his becoming-solitary. Colors,\n\nsilhouettes, and animal refrains are indexes of becoming-conjugal or\n\nbecoming-social that also imply components of deterritorialization. A\n\nquality functions only as a line of deterritorialization of an assemblage, or\n\nin going from one assemblage to another. This is why an animal-block is\n\nsomething other than a phylogenetic memory, and a childhood block\n\nsomething other than a childhood memory. In Kafka, a quality never\n\nfunctions for itself or as a memory, but rather rectifies an assemblage in\n\nwhich it is deterritori-alized, and, conversely, for which it provides a line\n\nof deterritorialization; for example, the childhood steeple passes into the\n\ncastle tower, takes it at the level of its zone of indiscernibility\n\n(\"battlements that were irregular, broken, fumbling\"), and launches down\n\na line of flight (as if one of the tenants \"had burst through the roof').\n\n99\n\nIf\n\nthings are more complicated and less sober for Proust, it is because for\n\nhim qualities retain an air of reminiscence _or _phantasy, and yet with\n\nProust as well these are functional blocks acting not as memories or\n\nphantasies but as a becoming-child, a becoming-woman, as components\n\nof deterritorialization passing from one assemblage to another.\n\nTo the theorems of simple deterritorialization we encountered earlier\n\n(in our discussion of the face),\n\n100\n\nwe can now add others on generalized\n\ndouble deterritorialization. _Theorem Five: _deterritorialization is always\n\ndouble, because it implies the coexistence of a major variable and a minor\n\nvariable in simultaneous becoming (the two terms of a becoming do not\n\nexchange places, there is no identification between them, they are instead\n\ndrawn into an asymmetrical block in which both change to the same extent,\n\nand which constitutes their zone of proximity). _Theorem Six: _in non-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)329.png)\n\n0\n\n1730:\n\nBECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL ...

One can only calculate and compare powers of deterritorialization).\n\nFernandez demonstrates the presence of becomings-woman, becom-\n\nings-child in vocal music. Then he decries the rise of instrumental and\n\norchestral music; he is particularly critical of Verdi and Wagner for having\n\nresexualized the voice, for having restored the binary machine in response\n\nto the requirements of capitalism, which wants a man to be a man and a\n\nwoman a woman, each with his or her own voice: Verdi-voices,\n\nWagner-voices, are reterritorialized upon man _and _woman. He explains the\n\npremature disappearance of Rossini and Bellini (the retirement of the first\n\nand death of the second) by their hopeless feeling that the vocal\n\nbecomings of the opera were no longer possible. However, Fernandez does\n\nnot ask under what auspices, and with what new types of diagonals, this\n\noccurs. To begin with, it is true that the voice ceases to be machined for\n\nitself, with simple instrumental accompaniment; it ceases to be a stratum\n\nor a line of expression that stands on its own. But why? Music crossed a\n\nnew threshold of deterritorialization, beyond which it is the instrument\n\nthat machines the voice, and the voice and instrument are carried _on the  \nsame plane _in a relation that is sometimes one of confrontation, sometimes\n\none of compensation, sometimes one of exchange and complementarity.\n\nThe lied, in particular Schumann's lieder, perhaps marks the first\n\nappearance of this pure movement that places the voice and the piano on\n\nthe same plane of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)330.png)\n\n0\n\n308 \u25a1\n\n1730: BECOMING-INTENSE, BECOMING-ANIMAL...\n\nconsistency, makes the piano an instrument of delirium, and prepares the\n\nway for Wagnerian opera. Even a case like Verdi's: it has often been said\n\nthat his opera remains lyrical and vocal in spite of its destruction of the\nbel\n\ncanto, and in spite of the importance of orchestration in the final works;\n\nstill, voices are instrumentalized and make extraordinary gains in tessitura\n\nor extension (the production of the Verdi-baritone, of the Verdi-soprano).\n\nAt any rate, the issue is not a given composer, especially not Verdi, or a\n\ngiven genre, but the more general movement affecting music, the slow\n\nmutation of the musical machine. If the voice returns to a binary distribu-\n\ntion of the sexes, this occurs in relation to binary groupings of instruments\n\nin orchestration. There are always molar systems in music that serve as\n\ncoordinates; this dualist system of the sexes that reappears on the level of\n\nthe voice, this molar and punctual distribution, serves as a foundation for\n\nnew molecular flows that then intersect, conjugate, are swept up in a kind\n\nof instrumentation and orchestration that tend to be part of the creation\n\nitself. Voices may be reterritorialized on the distribution of the two sexes,\n\nbut the continuous sound flow still passes between them as in a difference\n\nof potential.\n\nThis brings us to the second point: the principal problem concerning\n\nthis new threshold of deterritorialization of the voice is no longer that of a\n\nproperly vocal becoming-woman or becoming-child, but that of a\n\nbecoming-molecular in which the voice itself is instrumentalized. Of\n\ncourse, becomings-woman and -child remain just as important, even take\n\non new importance, but only to the extent that they convey another truth:\n\nwhat was produced was already a molecular child, a molecular woman .. .\n\nWe need only think of Debussy: the becoming-child and the\n\nbecoming-woman in his works are intense but are now inseparable from\n\na molecu-larization of the motif, a veritable \"chemistry\" achieved\n\nthrough orchestration. The child and the woman are now inseparable from\n\nthe sea and the water molecule _(Sirens, _precisely, represents one of the\n\nfirst complete attempts to integrate the voice with the orchestra). Already\n\nWagner was reproached for the \"elementary\" character of his music, for its\n\naquaticism, or its \"atomization\" of the motif, \"a subdivision into infinitely\n\nsmall units.\" This becomes even clearer if we think of becoming-animal:\n\nbirds are still just as important, yet the reign of birds seems to have been\n\nreplaced by the age of insects, with its much more molecular vibrations,\n\nchirring, rustling, buzzing, clicking, scratching, and scraping. Birds are\n\nvocal, but insects are instrumental: drums and violins, guitars and\n\ncymbals.\n\n101\n\nA becoming-insect has replaced becoming-bird, or forms a\n\nblock with it. The insect is closer, better able to make audible the truth\nthat\n\nall becomings are molecular (cf. Martenot's waves, electronic music).

That is how he populated the Gobi\n\ndesert with insects and stars constituting a becoming-music of the world, or\n\na diagonal for a cosmos. Messiaen presents multiple chromatic durations\n\nin coalescence, \"alternating between the longest and the shortest, in order\n\nto suggest the idea of the relations between the infinitely long durations of\n\nthe stars and mountains and the infinitely short ones of the insects and\n\natoms: a cosmic, elementary power that... derives above all from the labor\n\nof rhythm.\"\n\n102\n\nThe same thing that leads a musician to discover the birds\n\nalso leads him to discover the elementary and the cosmic. Both combine to\n\nform a block, a universe fiber, a diagonal or complex space. Music dis-\n\npatches molecular flows. Of course, as Messiaen says, music is not the priv-\n\nilege of human beings: the universe, the cosmos, is made of refrains; the\n\nquestion in music is that of a power of deterritorialization permeating\n\nnature, animals, the elements, and deserts as much as human beings. The\n\nquestion is more what is not musical in human beings, and what already is\n\nmusical in nature. Moreover, what Messiaen discovered in music is the\n\nsame thing the ethologists discovered in animals: human beings are hardly\n\nat an advantage, except in the means of overcoding, of making punctual\n\nsystems. That is even the opposite of having an advantage; through\n\nbecomings-woman, -child, -animal, or -molecular, nature opposes its\n\npower, and the power of music, to the machines of human beings, the roar\n\nof factories and bombers. And it is necessary to reach that point, it is\nneces-\n\nsary for the nonmusical sound of the human being to form a block with the\n\nbecoming-music of sound, for them to confront and embrace each other\n\nlike two wrestlers who can no longer break free from each other's grasp, and\n\nslide down a sloping line: \"Let the choirs represent the survivors. . .\nFaintly\n\none hears the sound of cicadas.

A child in the dark, gripped with fear, comforts himself by singing under  \nhis breath. He walks and halts to his song. Lost, he takes shelter, or orients  \nhimself with his little song as best he can. The song is like a rough sketch\nof a  \ncalming and stabilizing, calm and stable, center in the heart of chaos. Per-  \nhaps the child skips as he sings, hastens or slows his pace. But the song\nitself  \nis already a skip: it jumps from chaos to the beginnings of order in chaos  \nand is in danger of breaking apart at any moment. There is always sonority  \nin Ariadne's thread. Or the song of Orpheus.\n\nII. Now we are at home. But home does not preexist: it was necessary to\n\ndraw a circle around that uncertain and fragile center, to organize a limited  \nspace. Many, very diverse, components have a part in this, landmarks and  \nmarks of all kinds. This was already true of the previous case. But now the  \ncomponents are used for organizing a space, not for the momentary deter  \nmination of a center. The forces of chaos are kept outside as much as possi  \nble, and the interior space protects the germinal forces of a task to fulfill\nor  \na deed to do. This involves an activity of selection, elimination and extrac  \ntion, in order to prevent the interior forces of the earth from being sub  \nmerged, to enable them to resist, or even to take something from chaos  \nacross the filter or sieve of the space that has been drawn. Sonorous or vocal  \ncomponents are very important: a wall of sound, or at least a wall with  \nsome sonic bricks in it. A child hums to summon the strength for the  \nschoolwork she has to hand in. A housewife sings to herself, or listens to the  \nradio, as she marshals the antichaos forces of her work. Radios and televi  \nsion sets are like sound walls around every household and mark territories  \n(the neighbor complains when it gets too loud). For sublime deeds like the  \nfoundation of a city or the fabrication of a golem, one draws a circle, or bet  \nter yet walks in a circle as in a children's dance, combining rhythmic vowels  \nand consonants that correspond to the interior forces of creation as to the  \ndifferentiated parts of an organism. A mistake in speed, rhythm, or har  \nmony would be catastrophic because it would bring back the forces of  \nchaos, destroying both creator and creation.\n\nIII. Finally, one opens the circle a crack, opens it all the way, lets some\n\none in, calls someone, or else goes out oneself, launches forth. One opens  \nthe circle not on the side where the old forces of chaos press against it but\nin  \nanother region, one created by the circle itself. As though the circle tended  \non its own to open onto a future, as a function of the working forces it shel  \nters. This time, it is in order to join with the forces of the future, cosmic  \nforces. One launches forth, hazards an improvisation. But to improvise is  \nto join with the World, or meld with it. One ventures from home on the  \nthread of a tune.

They are three\n\naspects of a single thing, the Refrain _{ritournelle). _They are found in\ntales\n\n(both horror stories and fairy tales), and in lieder as well. The refrain has\n\nall three aspects, it makes them simultaneous or mixes them: sometimes,\n\nsometimes, sometimes. Sometimes chaos is an immense black hole in\n\nwhich one endeavors to fix a fragile point as a center. Sometimes one\n\norganizes around that point a calm and stable \"pace\" (rather than a form):\n\nthe black hole has become a home. Sometimes one grafts onto that pace a\n\nbreakaway from the black hole. Paul Klee presented these three aspects,\n\nand their interlinkage, in a most profound way. He calls the black hole a\n\n\"gray point\" for pictorial reasons. The gray point starts out as\n\nnonlocal-izable, nondimensional chaos, the force of chaos, a tangled\n\nbundle of aberrant lines. Then the point \"jumps over itself and radiates a\n\ndimensional space with horizontal layers, vertical cross sections,\n\nunwritten customary lines, a whole terrestrial interior force (this force also\n\nappears, at a more relaxed pace, in the atmosphere and in water). The gray\n\npoint (black hole) has thus jumped from one state to another, and no\n\nlonger represents chaos but the abode or home. Finally, the point launches\n\nout of itself, impelled by wandering centrifugal forces that fan out to the\n\nsphere of the cosmos: one \"tries convulsively to fly from the earth, but at\n\nthe following level one actually rises above it... powered by centrifugal\n\nforces that triumph over gravity.\"\n\n2\n\nThe role of the refrain has often been emphasized: it is territorial, a terri-\n\ntorial assemblage. Bird songs: the bird sings to mark its territory. The\n\nGreek modes and Hindu rhythms are themselves territorial, provincial,\n\nregional. The refrain may assume other functions, amorous, professional\n\nor social, liturgical or cosmic: it always carries earth with it; it has a\nland\n\n(sometimes a spiritual land) as its concomitant; it has an essential relation\n\nto a Natal, a Native. A musical \"nome\" is a little tune, a melodic formula\n\nthat seeks recognition and remains the bedrock or ground of polyphony  \n_{cantus firmus). _The _nomos _as customary, unwritten law is inseparable\n\nfrom a distribution of space, a distribution in space. By that token, it is  \n_ethos, _but the ethos is also the Abode.\n\n3\n\nSometimes one goes from chaos to\n\nthe threshold of a territorial assemblage: directional components,\n\ninfra-assemblage. Sometimes one organizes the assemblage: dimensional\n\ncomponents, intra-assemblage. Sometimes one leaves the territorial\n\nassemblage for other assemblages, or for somewhere else entirely:\n\ninterassem-blage, components of passage or even escape. And all three at\n\nonce. Forces of chaos, terrestrial forces, cosmic forces: all of these\n\nconfront each other and converge in the territorial refrain.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)335.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN D 313\n\nFrom chaos, _Milieus _and _Rhythms _are born. This is the concern of very\n\nancient cosmogonies. Chaos is not without its own directional compo-\n\nnents, which are its own ecstasies. We have seen elsewhere how all kinds of\n\nmilieus, each defined by a component, slide in relation to one another, over\n\none another. Every milieu is vibratory, in other words, a block of\n\nspace-time constituted by the periodic repetition of the component. Thus\n\nthe living thing has an exterior milieu of materials, an interior milieu of\n\ncomposing elements and composed substances, an intermediary milieu of\n\nmembranes and limits, and an annexed milieu of energy sources and\n\nactions-perceptions. Every milieu is coded, a code being defined by peri-\n\nodic repetition; but each code is in a perpetual state of transcoding or\n\ntransduction. Transcoding or transduction is the manner in which one\n\nmilieu serves as the basis for another, or conversely is established atop\n\nanother milieu, dissipates in it or is constituted in it. The notion of the\n\nmilieu is not unitary: not only does the living thing continually pass from\n\none milieu to another, but the milieus pass into one another, they are essen-\n\ntially communicating. The milieus are open to chaos, which threatens\n\nthem with exhaustion or intrusion. Rhythm is the milieus' answer to chaos.\n\nWhat chaos and rhythm have in common is the in-between\u2014between two\n\nmilieus, rhythm-chaos or the chaosmos: _\"Between _night and day, between\n\nthat which is constructed and that which grows naturally, between muta-\n\ntions from the inorganic to the organic, from plant to animal, from animal\n\nto humankind, yet without this series constituting a progression ...\" In this\n\nin-between, chaos becomes rhythm, not inexorably, but it has a chance to.\n\nChaos is not the opposite of rhythm, but the milieu of all milieus. There is\n\nrhythm whenever there is a transcoded passage from one milieu to\n\nanother, a communication of milieus, coordination between heterogene-\n\nous space-times. Drying up, death, intrusion have rhythm. It is well known\n\nthat rhythm is not meter or cadence, even irregular meter or cadence: there\n\nis nothing less rhythmic than a military march. The tom-tom is not 1 -2, the\n\nwaltz is not 1, 2, 3, music is not binary or ternary, but rather forty-seven\n\nbasic meters, as in Turkish music. Meter, whether regular or not, assumes a\n\ncoded form whose unit of measure may vary, but in a noncommunicating\n\nmilieu, whereas rhythm is the Unequal or the Incommensurable that is\n\nalways undergoing transcoding. Meter is dogmatic, but rhythm is critical;\n\nit ties together critical moments, or ties itself together in passing from one\n\nmilieu to another. It does not operate in a homogeneous space-time, but by\n\nheterogeneous blocks. It changes direction. Bachelard is right to say that  \n_\"the link between truly active moments (rhythm) is always effected on a dif-  \nferent plane from the one upon which the action is carried out.\"_\n\n_4_\n\n_ _Rhythm is\n\nnever on the same plane as that which has rhythm.

To change milieus, taking them as you find them:\n\nSuch is rhythm. Landing, splashdown, takeoff.. . This easily avoids an\n\naporia that threatened to introduce meter into rhythm, despite all the dec-\n\nlarations of intent to the contrary: How can one proclaim the constituent\n\ninequality of rhythm while at the same time admitting implied vibrations,\n\nperiodic repetitions of components? A milieu does in fact exist by virtue of\n\na periodic repetition, but one whose only effect is to produce a difference\n\nby which the milieu passes into another milieu. It is the difference that is\n\nrhythmic, not the repetition, which nevertheless produces it: productive\n\nrepetition has nothing to do with reproductive meter. This is the \"critical\n\nsolution of the antinomy.\"\n\nOne case of transcoding is particularly important: when a code is not\n\ncontent to take or receive components that are coded differently, and\n\ninstead takes or receives fragments of a different code as such. The first\n\ncase pertains to the leaf-water relation, the second to the spider-fly rela-\n\ntion. It has often been noted that the spider web implies that there are\n\nsequences of the fly's own code in the spider's code; it is as though the spi-\n\nder had a fly in its head, a fly \"motif,\" a fly \"refrain.\" The implication may\n\nbe reciprocal, as with the wasp and the orchid, or the snapdragon and the\n\nbumblebee. Jakob von Uexkiill has elaborated an admirable theory of\n\ntranscodings. He sees the components as melodies in counterpoint, each of\n\nwhich serves as a motif for another: Nature as music.\n\n5\n\nWhenever there is\n\ntranscoding, we can be sure that there is not a simple addition, but the con-\n\nstitution of a new plane, as of a surplus value. A melodic or rhythmic plane,\n\nsurplus value of passage or bridging. The two cases, however, are never\n\npure; they are in reality mixed (for example, the relation of the leaf, this\n\ntime not to water in general but to rain).\n\nStill, we do not yet have a _Territory, _which is not a milieu, not even an\n\nadditional milieu, nor a rhythm or passage between milieus. The territory\n\nis in fact an act that affects milieus and rhythms, that \"territorializes\"\n\nthem. The territory is the product of a territorialization of milieus and\n\nrhythms. It amounts to the same thing to ask when milieus and rhythms\n\nbecome territorialized, and what the difference is between a nonterritorial\n\nanimal and a territorial animal. A territory borrows from all the milieus; it\n\nbites into them, seizes them bodily (although it remains vulnerable to\n\nintrusions). It is built from aspects or portions of milieus. It itself has an\n\nexterior milieu, an interior milieu, an intermediary milieu, and an\n\nannexed milieu. It has the interior zone of a residence or shelter, the exte-\n\nrior zone of its domain, more or less retractable limits or membranes,\n\nintermediary or even neutralized zones, and energy reserves or annexes.

There is a territory pre-\n\ncisely when milieu components cease to be directional, becoming dimen-\n\nsional instead, when they cease to be functional to become expressive.\n\nThere is a territory when the rhythm has expressiveness. What defines the\n\nterritory is the emergence of matters of expression (qualities). Take the\n\nexample of color in birds or fish: color is a membrane state associated with\n\ninterior hormonal states, but it remains functional and transitory as long as\n\nit is tied to a type of action (sexuality, aggressiveness, flight). It becomes\n\nexpressive, on the other hand, when it acquires a temporal constancy and a\n\nspatial range that make it a territorial, or rather territorializing, mark: a\nsig-\n\nnature.\n\n6\n\nThe question is not whether color resumes its functions or fulfills\n\nnew ones in the territory. It is clear that it does, but this reorganization\nof\n\nfunctions implies first of all that the component under consideration has\n\nbecome expressive and that its meaning, from this standpoint, is to mark a\n\nterritory. The same species of birds may have colored and uncolored repre-\n\nsentatives; the colored birds have a territory, whereas the all-white ones are\n\ngregarious. We know what role urine and excrement play in marking, but\n\nterritorial excrement, for example, in the rabbit, has a particular odor\n\nowing to specialized anal glands. Many monkeys, when serving as guards,\n\nexpose their brightly colored sexual organs: the penis becomes a rhythmic\n\nand expressive color-carrier that marks the limits of the territory.\n\n7\n\nA milieu\n\ncomponent becomes both a quality and a property, _quale _and _proprium. _It\n\nhas been remarked how quick this becoming is in many cases, the rapidity\n\nwith which a territory is constituted at the same time as expressive quali-\n\nties are selected or produced. The brown stagemaker _{Scenopoeetes  \ndentirostris) _lays down landmarks each morning by dropping leaves it picks\n\nfrom its tree, and then turning them upside down so the paler underside\n\nstands out against the dirt: inversion produces a matter of expression.\n\n8\n\nThe territory is not primary in relation to the qualitative mark; it is the\n\nmark that makes the territory. Functions in a territory are not primary;\n\nthey presuppose a territory-producing expressiveness. In this sense, the\n\nterritory, and the functions performed within it, are products of\n\nterritorialization. Territorialization is an act of rhythm that has become\n\nexpressive, or of milieu components that have become qualitative. The\n\nmarking of a territory is dimensional, but it is not a meter, it is a rhythm.\nIt\n\nretains the most general characteristic of rhythm, which is to be inscribed\n\non a different plane than that of its actions. But now the distinction\n\nbetween the two planes is between territorializing expressions and\n\nterritorialized functions.

It is obvious that the function of aggression changes pace when\n\nit becomes intraspecific. but this reorganization of the function, rather\n\nthan explaining the territory, presupposes it. there are numerous reorgani-\n\nzations within the territory, which also affect sexuality, hunting, etc.;\nthere\n\nare even new functions, such as building a place to live.

Property, collective or individual, is derived from\n\nthat even when it is in the service of war and oppression. Property is funda-\n\nmentally artistic because art is fundamentally _poster, placard. _As Lorenz\n\nsays, coral fish are posters. The expressive is primary in relation to the\npos-\n\nsessive; expressive qualities, or matters of expression, are necessarily\n\nappropriative and constitute a having more profound than being.\n\n10\n\nNot in\n\nthe sense that these qualities belong to a subject, but in the sense that they\n\ndelineate a territory that will belong to the subject that carries or produces\n\nthem. These qualities are signatures, but the signature, the proper name, is\n\nnot the constituted mark of a subject, but the constituting mark of a\n\ndomain, an abode. The signature is not the indication of a person; it is the\n\nchancy formation of a domain. Abodes have proper names, and are\n\ninspired. \"The inspired and their abodes . . .\"; it is with the abode that\n\ninspiration arises. No sooner do I like a color that I make it my standard or\n\nplacard. One puts one's signature on something just as one plants one's flag\n\non a piece of land. A high school supervisor stamped all the leaves strewn\n\nabout the school yard and then put them back in their places. He had\n\nsigned. Territorial marks are readymades.

We are not going in circles. What we wish to say is that\n\nthere is a self-movement of expressive qualities. Expressiveness is not\n\nreducible to the immediate effects of an impulse triggering an action in a\n\nmilieu: effects of that kind are subjective impressions or emotions rather\n\nthan expressions (as, for example, the temporary color a freshwater fish\n\ntakes on under a given impulse). On the other hand, expressive qualities,\n\nthe colors of the coral fish, for example, are auto-objective, in other words,\n\nfind an objectivity in the territory they draw.\n\nWhat is this objective movement? What does a matter _do _as a matter of\n\nexpression? It is first of all a poster or placard, but that is not all it is.\nIt\n\nmerely takes that route. The signature becomes style. In effect, _expressive  \nqualities or matters of expression enter shifting relations with one another  \nthat \"express\" the relation of the territory they draw to the interior milieu\nof  \nimpulses and exterior milieu of circumstances. _To express is not to depend\n\nupon; there is an autonomy of expression. On the one hand, expressive\n\nqualities entertain internal relations with one another that constitute\n_terri-  \ntorial motifs; _sometimes these motifs loom above the internal impulses,\n\nsometimes they are superposed upon them, sometimes they ground one\n\nimpulse in another, sometimes they pass and cause a passage from one\n\nimpulse to another, sometimes they insert themselves between them\u2014but\n\nthey are not themselves \"pulsed.\" Sometimes these nonpulsed motifs arise\n\nin a fixed form, or seem to arise that way, but at other times the same ones,\n\nor others, take on variable speed and articulation; it is as much their varia-\n\nbility as their fixity that makes them independent of the drives they com-\n\nbine or neutralize. \"We know that our dogs go through motions of smelling,\n\nseeking, chasing, biting, and shaking to death with equal enthusiasm\n\nwhether they are hungry or not.\"\n\n12\n\nAnother example is the dance of the\n\nstickleback. Its zigzag is a motif in which the zig is tied to an aggressive\n\ndrive toward the partner, and the zag to a sexual drive toward the nest; yet\n\nthe zig and the zag are accented, or even oriented, differently. On the other\n\nhand, expressive qualities also entertain other internal relations that pro-\n\nduce _territorial counterpoints: _this refers to the manner in which they con-\n\nstitute points in the territory that place the circumstances of the external\n\nmilieu in counterpoint.

For this relation can be given without the circum-\n\nstances being given, just as the relation to the impulses can be given with-\n\nout the impulse being given. And even when the impulses and circum-\n\nstances are given, the relation is prior to what it places in relation.\n\nRelations between matters of expression express relations of the territory\n\nto internal impulses and external circumstances: they have an autonomy\n\nwithin this very expression. In truth, territorial motifs and counterpoints\n\nexplore potentialities of the interior or exterior milieu. Ethologists have\n\ngrouped these phenomena under the concept of \"ritualization\" and have\n\ndemonstrated the link between animal rituals and territory. But this word\n\nis not necessarily appropriate for these nonpulsed motifs and nonlocalized\n\ncounterpoints, since it accounts for neither their variability nor their\nfixity.\n\nIt is not one _or _the other, fixity or variability; certain motifs or points\nare\n\nfixed only if others are variable, or else they are fixed on one occasion and\n\nvariable on another.\n\nWe should say, rather, that territorial motifs form _rhythmic faces or char-_\n\n_acters, _and that territorial counterpoints form _melodic landscapes. _There\nis\n\na rhythmic character when we find that we no longer have the simple situa-\n\ntion of a rhythm associated with a character, subject, or impulse. The\n\nrhythm itself is now the character in its entirety; as such, it may remain\ncon-\n\nstant, or it may be augmented or diminished by the addition or subtraction\n\nof sounds or always increasing or decreasing durations, and by an amplifi-\n\ncation or elimination bringing death or resuscitation, appearance or disap-\n\npearance. Similarly, the melodic landscape is no longer a melody associ-\n\nated with a landscape; the melody itself is a sonorous landscape in\n\ncounterpoint to a virtual landscape. That is how we get beyond the placard\n\nstage: although each expressive quality, each matter of expression consid-\n\nered in itself, is a placard or poster, the analysis of them is nevertheless\n\nabstract. Expressive qualities entertain variable or constant relations with\n\none another (that is what matters of expression _do); _they no longer consti-\n\ntute placards that mark a territory, but motifs and counterpoints that\n\nexpress the relation of the territory to interior impulses or exterior circum-\n\nstances, whether or not they are given.

We can then say that the musician bird goes from sadness to joy or\n\nthat it greets the rising sun or endangers itself in order to sing or sings\nbetter\n\nthan another, etc. None of these formulations carries the slightest risk of\n\nanthropomorphism, or implies the slightest interpretation.

The relation to joy and sadness, the sun, danger, per-\n\nfection, is given in the motif and counterpoint, even if the term of each of\n\nthese relations is not given. In the motif and the counterpoint, the sun, joy\n\nor sadness, danger, become sonorous, rhythmic, or melodic.\n\n13\n\nHuman music also goes this route. For Swann, the art lover, Vinteuil's\n\nlittle phrase often acts as a placard associated with the Bois de Boulogne\n\nand the face and character of Odette: as if it reassured Swann that the Bois\n\nde Boulogne was indeed his territory, and Odette his possession. There is\n\nalready something quite artistic in this way of hearing music. Debussy crit-\n\nicized Wagner, comparing his leitmotifs to signposts signaling the hidden\n\ncircumstances of a situation, the secret impulses of a character. The criti-\n\ncism is accurate, on one level or at certain moments. But as the work devel-\n\nops, the motifs increasingly enter into conjunction, conquer _their own  \nplane, _become autonomous from the dramatic action, impulses, and situa-\n\ntions, and independent of characters and landscapes; they themselves\n\nbecome melodic landscapes and rhythmic characters continually enrich-\n\ning their internal relations. They may then remain relatively constant, or\n\non the contrary grow or diminish, expand or contract, vary in the speed at\n\nwhich they unfold: in both cases, they are no longer pulsed and localized,\n\nand even the constants are in the service of variation; the more provisory\n\nthey are, the more they display the continuous variation they resist, the\n\nmore rigid they become.\n\n14\n\nProust was among the first to underscore this life\n\nof the Wagnerian motif. Instead of the motif being tied to a character who\n\nappears, the appearance of the motif itself constitutes a rhythmic character\n\nin \"the plenitude of a music that is indeed filled with so many strains, each\n\nof which is a being.\"\n\n15\n\nIt is not by chance that the apprenticeship of the\n\n_Recherche _pursues an analogous discovery in relation to Vinteuil's little\n\nphrases: they do not refer to a landscape; they carry and develop within\n\nthemselves landscapes that do not exist on the outside (the white sonata\n\nand red septet. ..). The discovery of the properly melodic landscape and\n\nthe properly rhythmic character marks the moment of art when it ceases to\n\nbe a silent painting on a signboard. This may not be art's last word, but art\n\nwent that route, as did the bird: motifs and counterpoints that form an\n\nautodevelopment, in other words, a style. The interiorization of the\n\nmelodic or sonorous landscape finds its exemplary form in Liszt and that\n\nof the rhythmic character in Wagner. More generally, the lied is the musical\n\nart of the landscape, the most pictorial, impressionist form of music. But\n\nthe two poles are so closely bound that in the lied as well Nature appears as\n\na rhythmic character with infinite transformations.\n\nThe territory is first of all the critical distance between two beings of the\n\nsame species: Mark your distance. What is mine is first of all my distance; I\n\npossess only distances.

Critical distance is a relation based on mat-\n\nters of expression. It is a question of keeping at a distance the forces of\n\nchaos knocking at the door. _Mannerism: _the ethos is both abode and man-\n\nner, homeland and style. This is evident in territorial dances termed\n\nbaroque or mannerist, in which each pose, each movement, establishes a\n\ndistance of this kind (sarabands, allemandes, bourrees, gavottes.. .).\n\n16\n\nThere is a whole art of poses, postures, silhouettes, steps, and voices. Two\n\nschizophrenics converse or stroll according to laws of boundary and terri-\n\ntory that may escape us. How very important it is, when chaos threatens, to\n\ndraw an inflatable, portable territory. If need be, I'll put my territory on\nmy\n\nown body, I'll territorialize my body: the house of the tortoise, the hermit-\n\nage of the crab, but also tattoos that make the body a territory. Critical\ndis-\n\ntance is not a meter, it is a rhythm. But the rhythm, precisely, is caught up\nin\n\na becoming that sweeps up the distances between characters, making them\n\nrhythmic characters that are themselves more or less distant, more or less\n\ncombinable (intervals). Two animals of the same sex and species confront\n\neach other: the rhythm of the first one \"expands\" when it approaches its\n\nterritory or the center of its territory; the rhythm of the second contracts\n\nwhen it moves away from its territory. Between the two, at the boundaries,\n\nan oscillational constant is established: an active rhythm, a passively\n\nendured rhythm, and a witness rhythm?\n\n17\n\nOr else the animal opens its terri-\n\ntory a crack for a partner of the opposite sex: a complex rhythmic character\n\nforms through duets, antiphonal or alternating singing, as in the case of\n\nAfrican shrikes. Furthermore, we must simultaneously take into account\n\ntwo aspects of the territory: it not only ensures and regulates the coexis-\n\ntence of members of the same species by keeping them apart, but makes\n\npossible the coexistence of a maximum number of different species in the\n\nsame milieu by specializing them. Members of the same species enter into\n\nrhythmic characters at the same time as different species enter into\n\nmelodic landscapes; for the landscapes are peopled by characters and the\n\ncharacters belong to landscapes. An example is Messiaen's  \n_Chrono-chromie, _with its eighteen bird songs forming autonomous\n\nrhythmic characters and simultaneously realizing an extraordinary\n\nlandscape in complex counterpoint, with invented or implicit chords.\n\nNot only does art not wait for human beings to begin, but we may ask if\n\nart ever appears among human beings, except under artificial and belated\n\nconditions. It has often been noted that human art was for a long time\n\nbound up with work and rites of a different nature. Saying this, however,\n\nperhaps has no more weight than saying that art begins with human beings.\n\nFor it is true that a territory has two notable effects: _a reorganization of  \nfunctions and a regrouping of forces. _On the one hand, when functional\n\nactivities are territorialized they necessarily change pace (the creation of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)343.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 321\n\nnew functions such as building a dwelling, or the transformation of old\n\nfunctions, as when aggressiveness changes nature and becomes\n\nintra-specific). This is like a nascent theme of specialization or\n\nprofessionalism: if the territorial refrain so often passes into professional\n\nrefrains, it is because professions assume that various activities are\n\nperformed in the same milieu, and that the same activity has no other\n\nagents in the same territory. Professional refrains intersect in the milieu,\n\nlike merchants' cries, but each marks a territory within which the same\n\nactivity cannot be performed, nor the same cry ring out. In animals as in\n\nhuman beings, there are rules of critical distance for competition: my stretch\n\nof sidewalk. In short, a territorialization of functions is the condition for\n\ntheir emergence as \"occupations\" or \"trades.\" Thus intraspecific or\n\nspecialized aggressiveness is necessarily a territorialized aggressiveness;\n\nit does not explain the territory since it itself derives from it. It is\n\nimmediately apparent that all activities within the territory adopt a new\n\npractical pace. But that is no reason to conclude that art in itself does not\n\nexist here, for it is present in the territorializing factor that is the\n\nnecessary condition for the emergence of the work-function.\n\nThe situation is the same if we consider the other effect of territori-\n\nalization. That other effect, which relates not to occupations but to rites\n\nand religions, consists in this: the territory groups all the forces of the\ndif-\n\nferent milieus together in a single sheaf constituted by the forces of the\n\nearth. The attribution of all the diffuse forces to the earth as receptacle or\n\nbase takes place only at the deepest level of each territory. \"The surround-\n\ning milieu was experienced as a unity; it is very hard to distinguish in these\n\nprimal intuitions what belongs properly to the earth from what is merely\n\nmanifested through the earth: mountains, forests, water, vegetation.\"\n\n18\n\nThe forces of air and water, bird and fish, thus become forces of the earth.\n\nMoreover, although in extension the territory separates the interior forces\n\nof the earth from the exterior forces of chaos, the same does not occur in\n\n\"intension,\" in the dimension of depth, where the two types of force clasp\n\nand are wed in a battle whose only criterion and stakes is the earth. There is\n\nalways a place, a tree or grove, in the territory where all the forces come\n\ntogether in a hand-to-hand combat of energies. The earth is this close\n\nembrace.\n\n19\n\nThis intense center is simultaneously inside the territory, and\n\noutside several territories that converge on it at the end of an immense pil-\n\ngrimage (hence the ambiguities of the \"natal\"). Inside or out, the territory\n\nis linked to this intense center, which is like the unknown homeland, terres-\n\ntrial source of all forces friendly and hostile, where everything is decided.\n\n20\n\nSo we must once again acknowledge that religion, which is common to\n\nhuman beings and animals, occupies territory only because it depends on\n\nthe raw aesthetic and territorializing factor as its necessary condition.

We\n\ntherefore need a notion, even an apparently negative one, that can grasp\n\nthis fictional or raw moment. The essential thing is the disjunction notice-\n\nable between the code and the territory. The territory arises in a free margin\n\nof the code, one that is not indeterminate but rather is determined differ-\n\nently. Each milieu has its own code, and there is perpetual transcoding\n\nbetween milieus; the territory, on the other hand, seems to form at the level\n\nof a certain _decoding. _Biologists have stressed the importance of these\n\ndetermined margins, which are not to be confused with mutations, in other\n\nwords, changes internal to the code: here, it is a question of duplicated\n\ngenes or extra chromosomes that are not inside the genetic code, are free of\n\nfunction, and offer a free matter for variation.\n\n21\n\nBut it is very unlikely that\n\nthis kind of matter could create new species independently of mutations,\n\nunless it were accompanied by events of another order capable of multiply-\n\ning the interactions of the organism with its milieus. Territorialization is\n\nprecisely such a factor that lodges on the margins of the code of a single\nspe-\n\ncies and gives the separate representatives of that species the possibility of\n\ndifferentiating. It is because there is a disjunction between the territory\n\nand the code that the territory can indirectly induce new species. Wherever\n\nterritoriality appears, it establishes an intraspecific _critical distance _\n\nbetween members of the same species; it is by virtue of its own disjunction\n\nin relation to _specific differences _that it becomes an oblique, indirect\nmeans\n\nof differentiation. From all of these standpoints, decoding appears as the\n\n\"negative\" of the territory, and the most obvious distinction between terri-\n\ntorial animals and nonterritorial animals is that the former are much less\n\ncoded than the latter.

The territory itself\n\nis a place of passage. The territory is the first assemblage, the first thing\nto\n\nconstitute an assemblage; the assemblage is fundamentally territorial. But\n\nhow could it not already be in the process of passing into something else,\n\ninto other assemblages? That is why we could not talk about the constitu-\n\ntion of the territory without also talking about its internal organization.\n\nWe could not describe the infra-assemblage (posters or placards) without\n\nalso discussing the intra-assemblage (motifs and counterpoints). Nor can\n\nwe say anything about the intra-assemblage without already being on the\n\npath to other assemblages, or elsewhere. The passage of the Refrain. The\n\nrefrain moves in the direction of the territorial assemblage and lodges itself\n\nthere or leaves. In a general sense, _we call a refrain any aggregate of\nmatters  \nof expression that draws a territory and develops into territorial motifs and  \nlandscapes _(there are optical, gestural, motor, etc., refrains). In the\nnarrow\n\nsense, we speak of a refrain when an assemblage is sonorous or \"domi-\n\nnated\" by sound\u2014but why do we assign this apparent privilege to sound?\n\nWe are now in the intra-assemblage. Its organization is very rich and\n\ncomplex. It includes not only the territorial assemblage but also assem-\n\nbled, territorialized functions. Take the Troglodytidae, the wren family:\n\nthe male takes possession of his territory and produces a \"music box\n\nrefrain\" as a warning to possible intruders; he builds his own nests in his\n\nterritory, sometimes as many as a dozen; when a female arrives, he sits in\n\nfront of a nest, invites her to visit, hangs his wings, and lowers the inten-\n\nsity of his song, reduced to a mere trill.\n\n22\n\nIt seems that the nesting function\n\nis highly territorialized, since the nests are prepared by the male alone\n\nbefore the arrival of the female, who only visits and completes them; the\n\n\"courtship\" function is also territorialized, but to a lesser degree, since\n\nthe territorial refrain becomes seductive by changing in intensity. All\n\nkinds of heterogeneous elements show up in the intra-assemblage: not\n\nonly the assemblage marks that group materials, colors, odors, sounds,\n\npostures, etc., but also the various elements of given assembled behaviors\n\nthat enter into a motif. For example, a display behavior is composed of a\n\ndance, clicking of the beak, an exhibition of colors, a posture with neck\n\noutstretched, cries, smoothing of the feathers, bows, a refrain. .. The first\n\nquestion to be asked is what holds these territorializing marks, territorial\n\nmotifs, and territorialized functions together in the same intra-assem-\n\nblage. This is a question _of consistency: _the \"holding together\" of hetero-\n\ngeneous elements. At first, they constitute no more than a fuzzy set, a\n\ndiscrete set that later takes on consistency.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)346.png)\n\n324 \u25a1 1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\nBut another question seems to interrupt or cut across the first one. For\n\nin many cases, a territorialized, assembled function acquires enough\n\nindependence to constitute a new assemblage, one that is more or less\n\ndeterritorialized, en route to deterritorialization. There is no need to\n\neffectively leave the territory to go this route; but what just a minute ago\n\nwas a constituted function in the territorial assemblage has become the\n\nconstituting element of another assemblage, the element of passage to\n\nanother assemblage. As in courtly love, a color ceases to be territorial and\n\nenters a \"courtship\" assemblage. The territorial assemblage opens onto\n\nthe courtship assemblage, which is a social assemblage that has gained\n\nautonomy. That is what happens when it is specifically the sexual partner\n\nor the members of a group that are recognized, rather than the territory:\n\nThe partner is then said to be a _Tier mit der Heimvalenz, _\"an animal with\n\nhome value.\" There is therefore a distinction to be made between milieu\n\ngroups and couples (without individual recognition), territorial groups\n\nand couples (in which there is only recognition inside the territory), and\n\nfinally social groups and love couples (when there is recognition indepen-\n\ndent of place).\n\n23\n\nCourtship, or the group, is no longer a part of the territorial\n\nassemblage; a courtship or group assemblage takes on autonomy\u2014 even\n\nthough it may stay inside the territory. Conversely, in the new assemblage\n\nthere is a reterritorialization on the member of the couple or members of\n\nthe group that have-the-value-of (valence). This opening of the\n\nassemblage onto other assemblages can be analyzed in detail, and varies\n\nwidely. For example, when the male does not make the nest and confines\n\nhimself to transporting materials or mimicking the construction of a nest\n\n(as in Australian grass finches), he either courts the female holding a\n\npiece of stubble in his beak (genus _Bathilda), _uses the grass stem only in\n\nthe initial stages of courtship or even beforehand (genera _Aidemosyne _and  \n_Lonchura), _or pecks at the grass without offering it (genus _Emblema)._\n\n_24 _\n\nIt\n\ncould always be said that these \"grass stem\" behaviors are merely archa-\n\nisms, or vestiges of nesting behavior. But the notion of behavior itself\n\nproves inadequate to this assemblage. For when the nest is no longer made\n\nby the male, nesting ceases to be a component of the territorial\n\nassemblage\u2014it takes wing, so to speak, from the territory; furthermore,\n\ncourtship, which now precedes nesting, itself becomes a relatively autono-\n\nmous assemblage. In addition, the matter of expression, \"grass stem,\" acts\n\nas a component of passage between the territorial assemblage and the\n\ncourtship assemblage. The fact that the grass stem has an increasingly\n\nrudimentary function in certain species, the fact that it tends to cancel out\n\nin the series under consideration, is not enough to make it a vestige, much\n\nless a symbol. A matter of expression is never a vestige or a symbol. The\n\ngrass stem is a deterritorialized component, or one en route to\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)347.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 325\n\ndeterritorialization.

This viewpoint is confirmed by the fact that if the\n\nstem cancels out, another relay component replaces it or assumes greater\n\nimportance, namely, the refrain, which is not only territorial but becomes\n\namorous and social, and changes accordingly.\n\n25\n\nThe question of why, in the\n\nconstitution of new assemblages, the sound component \"refrain\" has a\n\nstronger valence than the gestural component \"grass stem\" can be consid-\n\nered only later on.

The\n\ngrass stem and the refrain are two agents of these forces, two agents of\n\ndeterritorialization.\n\nThe territorial assemblage continually passes into other assemblages.\n\nLikewise, the infra-assemblage is inseparable from the intra-assemblage,\n\nas is the intra-assemblage from interassemblages; yet these passages are\n\nnot necessary but rather take place \"on a case-by-case basis.\" The reason\n\nis simple: the intra-assemblage, the territorial assemblage, territorializes\nfunc-\n\ntions and forces (sexuality, aggressiveness, gregariousness, etc.), and in\n\nthe process of territorializing them, transforms them. But these\n\nterritorialized functions and forces can suddenly take on an autonomy\n\nthat makes them swing over into other assemblages, compose other\n\ndeterritorialized assemblages. In the intra-assemblage, sexuality may\n\nappear as a territorialized function, but it can just as easily draw a line of\n\ndeterritorialization that describes another assemblage; there are therefore\n\nquite variable relations between sexuality and the territory, as if sexuality\n\nwere keeping \"its distance.\" Profession, trade, and specialty imply\n\nterritorialized activities, but they can also take wing from the territory,\n\nbuilding a new assemblage around themselves, and between professions.\n\nA territorial or territorialized component may set about budding, pro-\n\nducing: this is the case for the refrain, so much so that we should perhaps\n\ncall all cases of this kind refrains. This ambiguity between the territory\n\nand deterritorialization is the ambiguity of the Natal. It is understood\n\nmuch more clearly if it is borne in mind that the territory has an intense\n\ncenter at its profoundest depths; but as we have seen, this intense center\n\ncan be located outside the territory, at the point of convergence of very\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)348.png)\n\n0\n\n326 D\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\ndifferent and very distant territories. The Natal is outside. We may cite a\n\ncertain number of troubling and well-known, more or less mysterious,\n\ncases illustrating prodigious takeoffs from the territory, displaying a vast\n\nmovement of deterritorialization directly plugged into the territories and\n\npermeating them through and through: (1) pilgrimages to the source, as\n\namong salmon; (2) supernumerary assemblies, such as those of locusts or\n\nchaffinches, etc. (tens of millions of chaffinches near Thoune in\n\n1950-1951); (3) magnetic or solar-guided migrations; (4) long marches,\n\nsuch as those of the lobsters.\n\n26\n\nWhatever the causes of each of these movements, it is clear that the\n\nnature of the movement is different. It is no longer adequate to say that\n\nthere is interassemblage, passage from a territorial assemblage to another\n\ntype of assemblage; rather, we should say that one leaves all assemblages\n\nbehind, that one exceeds the capacities of any possible assemblage, enter-\n\ning another plane. In effect, there is no longer a milieu movement or\n\nrhythm, nor a territorialized or territorializing movement or rhythm; there\n\nis something of the Cosmos in these more ample movements. The localiza-\n\ntion mechanisms are still extremely precise, but the localization has\n\nbecome cosmic. These are no longer territorialized forces bundled together\n\nas forces of the earth; they are the liberated or regained forces of a\n\ndeterritorialized Cosmos. In migration, the sun is no longer the terrestrial\n\nsun reigning over a territory, even an aerial one; it is the celestial sun of\nthe\n\nCosmos, as in the two Jerusalems, the Apocalypse. Leaving aside these two\n\ngrandiose cases where deterritorialization becomes absolute while losing\n\nnothing of its precision (because it weds cosmic variables), we must remark\n\nthat the territory is constantly traversed by movements of deterrito-\n\nrialization that are relative and may even occur in place, by which one\n\npasses from the intra-assemblage to interassemblages, without, however,\n\nleaving the territory or issuing from the assemblages in order to wed the\n\nCosmos. A territory is always en route to an at least potential deterrito-\n\nrialization, even though the new assemblage may operate a\n\nreterritoriali-zation (something that \"has-the-value-of' home). We saw that\n\nthe territory constituted itself on a margin of decoding affecting the milieu;\n\nwe now see that there is a margin of deterritorialization affecting the\n\nterritory itself. There is a series of unclaspings. The territory is\n\ninseparable from certain coefficients of deterritorialization (which can be\n\nevaluated in each case) that place the relations of each territorialized\n\nfunction to the territory in variation, as well as the relations of the\n\nterritory to each deterritorialized assemblage. It is the same \"thing\" that\n\nappears first as a territorialized function taken up in the intra-assemblage,\n\nand again as a deterritorialized or autonomous assemblage, as an\n\ninterassemblage.\n\nRefrains could accordingly be classified as follows: (1) territorial\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)349.png)\n\n1\n\n837: OF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 327\n\nrefrains that seek, mark, assemble a territory; (2) territorialized function\n\nrefrains that assume a special function in the assemblage (the Lullaby that\n\nterritorializes the child's slumber, the Lover's Refrain that territorializes\n\nthe sexuality of the loved one, the Professional Refrain that territorializes\n\ntrades and occupations, the Merchant Refrain that territorializes distribu-\n\ntion and products); (3) the same, when they mark new assemblages, pass\n\ninto new assemblages by means of deterritorialization-reterritorialization\n\n(nursery rhymes are a very complicated example: they are territorial\n\nrefrains that are sung differently from neighborhood to neighborhood,\n\nsometimes from one street to the next; they distribute game roles and func-\n\ntions within the territorial assemblage; but they also cause the territory to\n\npass into the game assemblage, which tends to become autonomous);\n\n27\n\n(4)\n\nrefrains that collect or gather forces, either at the heart of the territory,\nor in\n\norder to go outside it (these are refrains of confrontation or departure that\n\nsometimes bring on a movement of absolute deterritorialization:\n\n\"Goodbye, I'm leaving and I won't look back.\" At infinity, these refrains\n\nmust rejoin the songs of the Molecules, the newborn wailing of the funda-\n\nmental Elements, as Millikan put it. They cease to be terrestrial, becoming\n\ncosmic: when the religious Nome blooms and dissolves in a molecular pan-\n\ntheist Cosmos, when the singing of the birds is replaced by combinations of\n\nwater, wind, clouds, and fog. \"Outside, the wind and the rain ...\" The Cos-\n\nmos as an immense deterritorialized refrain).\n\nThe problem of _consistency _concerns the manner in which the compo-\n\nnents of a territorial assemblage hold together. But it also concerns the\n\nmanner in which different assemblages hold together, with components of\n\npassage and relay. It may even be the case that consistency finds the totality\n\nof its conditions only on a properly cosmic plane, where all the disparate\n\nand heterogeneous elements are convoked. However, from the moment\n\nheterogeneities hold together in an assemblage or interassemblages a prob-\n\nlem of consistency is posed, in terms of coexistence or succession, and both\n\nsimultaneously. Even in a territorial assemblage, it may be the most deter-\n\nritorialized component, the deterritorializing vector, in other words, the\n\nrefrain, that assures the consistency of the territory. If we ask the general\n\nquestion, \"What holds things together?\", the clearest, easiest answer seems\n\nto be provided by a formalizing, linear, hierarchized, centralized  \n_arborescent _model. Take Tinbergen's schema, which presents a coded link-\n\nage of spatiotemporal forms in the central nervous system: a higher func-\n\ntional center goes automatically into operation and releases an appetitive\n\nbehavior in search of specific stimuli (the migrational center); through the\n\nintermediary of the stimulus, a second center that had been inhibited up to\n\nthis point is freed and releases a new appetitive behavior (the territorial\n\ncenter); then other subordinate centers are activated, centers of fighting,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)350.png)\n\n328 \u25a1 1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\nnesting, courtship . . . until stimuli are found that release the correspond-\n\ning executive acts.\n\n28\n\nThis kind of representation, however, is constructed of\n\noversimplified binarities: inhibition-release, innate-acquired, etc.\n\nEtholo-gists have a great advantage over ethnologists: they did not fall\n\ninto the structural danger of dividing an undivided \"terrain\" into forms of\n\nkinship, politics, economics, myth, etc. The ethologists have retained the\n\nintegrality of a certain undivided \"terrain.\" But by orienting it along the\n\naxes of inhibition-release, innate-acquired, they risk reintroducing souls\n\nand centers at each locus and stage of linkage. That is why even the\n\nauthors who stress the role of the peripheral and the acquired at the level\n\nof releasing stimuli do not truly overturn the linear aborescent schema,\n\neven if they reverse the direction of the arrows.\n\nIt seems more important to us to underline a certain number of factors\n\nliable to suggest an entirely different schema, one favoring rhizomatic,\n\nrather than arborified, functioning, and no longer operating by these dual-\n\nisms. First of all, what is called a functional center brings into play not\nonly\n\na localization but also a distribution of an entire population of neurons\n\nselected from throughout the central nervous system, as in a \"cable net-\n\nwork.\" This being the case, in considering the system as a whole we should\n\nspeak less of automatism of a higher center than of coordination between\n\ncenters, and of the cellular groupings or molecular populations that per-\n\nform these couplings: there is no form or correct structure imposed from\n\nwithout or above but rather an articulation from within, as if oscillating\n\nmolecules, oscillators, passed from one heterogeneous center to another, if\n\nonly for the purpose of assuring the dominance of one among them.\n\n29\n\nThis\n\nobviously excludes any linear relation from one center to another, in favor\n\nof packets of relations steered by molecules: the interaction or coordina-\n\ntion may be positive _or _negative (release or inhibition), but it is never\n\ndirect, as in a linear relation or chemical reaction; it always occurs between\n\nmolecules with at least two heads, and each center taken separately.\n\n30\n\nThis represents a whole behavioral-biological \"machinics,\" a whole\n\nmolecular engineering that should help increase our understanding of the\n\nnature of problems of consistency. The philosopher Eugene Dupreel pro-\n\nposed a theory of _consolidation; _he demonstrated that life went not from a\n\ncenter to an exteriority but from an exterior to an interior, or rather from a\n\ndiscrete or fuzzy aggregate to its consolidation. This implies three things.\n\nFirst, that there is no beginning from which a linear sequence would derive,\n\nbut rather densifications, intensifications, reinforcements, injections,\n\nshowerings, like so many intercalary events (\"there is growth only by inter-\n\ncalation\"). Second, and this is not a contradiction, there must be an\n\narrangement of intervals, a distribution of inequalities, such that it is\n\nsometimes necessary to make a hole in order to consolidate. Third, there is\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)351.png)\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN D 329\n\na superposition of disparate rhythms, an articulation from within of an\n\ninterrhythmicity, with no imposition of meter or cadence.\n\n31\n\nConsolidation\n\nis not content to come after; it is creative. The fact is that the beginning\n\nalways begins in-between, intermezzo. Consistency is the same as consoli-\n\ndation, it is the act that produces consolidated aggregates, of succession as\n\nwell as of coexistence, by means of the three factors just mentioned: inter-\n\ncalated elements, intervals, and articulations of superposition. Architec-\n\nture, as the art of the abode and the territory, attests to this: there are\n\nconsolidations that are made afterward, and there are consolidations of the\n\nkeystone type that are constituent parts of the ensemble. More recently,\n\nmatters like reinforced concrete have made it possible for the architectural\n\nensemble to free itself from arborescent models employing tree-pillars,\n\nbranch-beams, foliage-vaults. Not only is concrete a heterogeneous matter\n\nwhose degree of consistency varies according to the elements in the mix,\n\nbut iron is intercalated following a rhythm; moreover, its _self-supporting  \nsurfaces _form a complex rhythmic personage whose \"stems\" have different\n\nsections and variable intervals depending on the intensity and direction of\n\nthe force to be tapped (armature instead of structure). In this sense, the\nlit-\n\nerary or musical work has an architecture: \"Saturate every atom,\" as Vir-\n\nginia Woolf said;\n\n32\n\nor in the words of Henry James, it is necessary to \"begin\n\nfar away, as far away as possible,\" and to proceed by \"blocks of wrought\n\nmatter.\" It is no longer a question of imposing a form upon a matter but of\n\nelaborating an increasingly rich and consistent material, the better to tap\n\nincreasingly intense forces. What makes a material increasingly rich is the\n\nsame as what holds heterogeneities together without their ceasing to be het-\n\nerogeneous. What holds them together in this way are intercalary oscilla-\n\ntors, synthesizers with at least two heads; these are interval analyzers,\n\nrhythm synchronizers (the word \"synchronizer\" is ambiguous because\n\nmolecular synchronizers do not proceed by homogenizing and equalizing\n\nmeasurement, but operate from within, between two rhythms). Is not con-\n\nsolidation the terrestrial name for consistency? The territorial assemblage\n\nis a milieu consolidation, a space-time consolidation, of coexistence and\n\nsuccession. And the refrain operates with these three factors.\n\nThe matters of expression themselves must present characteristics mak-\n\ning this taking on of consistency possible. We have seen that they have an\n\naptitude to enter into internal relations forming motifs and counterpoints:\n\nthe territorializing marks become territorial motifs or counterpoints, the\n\nsignatures and placards constitute a \"style.\" These are the elements of a\n\ndiscrete or fuzzy aggregate; but they become consolidated, take on consis-\n\ntency. To this extent, they have effects, such as reorganizing functions and\n\ngathering forces. To get a better grasp on the mechanism of this aptitude,\n\nwe may lay down certain conditions of homogeneity, beginning with marks\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)352.png)\n\n0\n\n330 \u25a1\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\nor matters of the same kind, for example, a set of sonorous marks, the song\n\nof a bird. The song of the chaffinch normally has three distinct phases: the\n\nfirst has from four to fourteen notes rising in crescendo but decreasing in\n\nfrequency; the second has from two to eight notes, lower than the first and\n\nof constant frequency; the third ends with a complex \"flourish\" or \"orna-\n\nment.\" From the standpoint of acquisition, this \"full song\" is preceded by a\n\n\"subsong\" that under normal conditions already assumes possession of the\n\ngeneral tonal quality, overall duration and content of the stanzas, and even\n\na tendency to end on a higher note.\n\n33\n\nBut the organization into three stan-\n\nzas, the order of the stanzas, the details and the ornament, are not pregiven;\n\nit is precisely the articulations from within that are missing, the intervals,\n\nthe intercalary notes, everything making for motif and counterpoint. The\n\ndistinction between subsong and full song could thus be presented as fol-\n\nlows: the subsong as mark or placard, the full song as style or motif, and the\n\naptitude to pass from one to the other, for one to consolidate itself in the\n\nother. Clearly, artificial isolation will have very different effects\ndepending\n\non whether it takes place before or after the acquisition of the components\n\nofthe subsong.\n\nOur present concern, however, is to find out what happens when these\n\ncomponents effectively develop into the motifs and counterpoints of the\n\nfull song. We must leave behind the conditions of qualitative homogeneity\n\nwe set for ourselves. For as long as we confine ourselves to marks, marks of\n\none kind coexist with marks of another kind, period: the sounds of an ani-\n\nmal coexist with its colors, gestures, silhouettes; or else the sounds of a\n\ngiven species coexist with the sounds of other species, perhaps quite differ-\n\nent but close in space. The organization of qualified marks into motifs and\n\ncounterpoints necessarily entails a taking on of consistency, or a capture of\n\nthe marks of another quality, a mutual branching of\n\nsounds-colors-gestures, or a capture of sounds from different animal\n\nspecies, etc. Consistency necessarily occurs between heterogeneities, not\n\nbecause it is the birth of a differentiation, but because heterogeneities that\n\nwere formerly content to coexist or succeed one another become bound up\n\nwith one another through the \"consolidation\" of their coexistence and\n\nsuccession. The intervals, intercalations, and articulations constitutive of\n\nmotifs and counterpoints in the order of an expressive quality also envelop\n\nother qualities of a different order, or qualities of the same order but of\n\nanother sex or even another species of animal. A color will \"answer to\" a\n\nsound. If a quality has motifs and counterpoints, if there are rhythmic\n\ncharacters and melodic landscapes in a given order, then there is the\n\nconstitution of a veritable _machinic opera _tying together orders, species,\n\nand heterogeneous qualities. What we term machinic is precisely this\n\nsynthesis of heterogeneities as such. Inasmuch as these heterogeneities are\n\nmatters of _expression, _we say\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)353.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 331\n\nthat their synthesis itself, their consistency or capture, forms a properly\n\nmachinic \"statement\" or \"enunciation.\" The varying relations into which\n\na color, sound, gesture, movement, or position enters in the same species,\n\nand in different species, form so many machinic enunciations.\n\nLet us return to the stagemaker, the magic bird or bird of the opera. He is\n\nnot brightly colored (as though there were an inhibition). But his song, his\n\nrefrain, can be heard from a great distance (is this a compensation, or on\n\nthe contrary the prime factor?). He sings perched on his singing stick, a\n\nvine or branch located just above the display ground he has prepared by\n\nmarking it with cut leaves turned upside down to contrast with the color of\n\nthe earth. As he sings, he uncovers the yellow root of certain feathers under-\n\nneath his beak: he makes himself visible at the same time as sonorous. His\n\nsong forms a varied and complex motif interweaving his own notes and\n\nthose of other birds that he imitates in the intervals.\n\n34\n\nThis produces a con-\n\nsolidation that \"consists\" in species-specific sounds, sounds of other spe-\n\ncies, leaf hue, throat color: the stagemaker's machinic statement or\n\nassemblage of enunciation. Many birds \"imitate\" the songs of other spe-\n\ncies. But imitation may not be the best concept for these phenomena,\n\nwhich vary according to the assemblage into which they enter. The subsong\n\ncontains elements that can enter into melodic and rhythmic organizations\n\ndistinct from those of the species under consideration, supplying the full\n\nsong with truly alien or added notes. If certain birds such as the chaffinch\n\nseem impervious to imitation, it is because any alien sounds appearing in\n\ntheir subsong are eliminated from the consistency of the full song. On the\n\nother hand, in cases where added phrases do get included in the full song, it\n\nmay be because there is an interspecific assemblage of the parasitism type;\n\nor it may be because the bird's assemblage itself effectuates the counter-\n\npoints to its melody. Thorpe is not wrong to say that the problem is one of\n\nthe occupation of frequency bands, as with radios (the sound aspect of ter-\n\nritoriality).\n\n35\n\nIt is less a question of imitating a song than of occupying cor-\n\nresponding frequencies; for there may be an advantage in being able to\n\nrestrict oneself to a very determinate zone in some circumstances, and in\n\nothers to widen or deepen the zone to assure oneself counterpoints and to\n\ninvent chords that would otherwise remain diffuse, as, for example, in the\n\nrain forest, which is precisely where the greatest number of \"imitative\"\n\nbirds are found.\n\nFrom the standpoint of consistency, matters of expression must be con-\n\nsidered not only in relation to their aptitude to form motifs and counter-\n\npoints but also in relation to the inhibitors and releasers that act on them,\n\nand the mechanisms of innateness or learning, heredity or acquisition, that\n\nmodulate them. Ethology's mistake is to restrict itself to a binary distri-\n\nbution of these factors, even, and especially, when it is thought necessary to\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)354.png)\n\n0\n\n332 \u25a1\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\ntake both into account simultaneously, to intermix them at every level of a\n\n\"tree of behaviors.\" Instead, what should be done is to start from a positive\n\nnotion capable of accounting for the very particular character the innate\n\nand the acquired assume in the rhizome, and which is like the principle of\n\ntheir mixture. Such a notion cannot be arrived at in terms of behavior but\n\nrather only in terms of assemblage. Some authors emphasize autonomous\n\ndevelopments encoded in centers (innateness); others emphasize acquired\n\nlinkages regulated by peripheral sensations (learning). But Raymond\n\nRuyer has demonstrated that the animal is instead prey to \"musical\n\nrhythms\" and \"melodic and rhythmic themes\" explainable neither as the\n\nencoding of a recorded phonograph disk nor by the movements of per-\n\nformance that effectuate them and adapt them to the circumstances.\n\n36\n\nThe\n\nopposite is even true: the melodic or rhythmic themes precede their per-\n\nformance and recording. What is primary is the consistency of a refrain, a\n\nlittle tune, either in the form of a mnemic melody that has no need to be\n\ninscribed locally in a center, or in the form of a vague motif with no need to\n\nbe pulsed or stimulated. There is perhaps more to be learned from a musi-\n\ncal and poetic notion such as the Natal\u2014in the lied, or in Holderlin or\n\nThomas Hardy\u2014than from the slightly vapid and foggy categories of the\n\ninnate and the acquired. For from the moment there is a territorial assem-\n\nblage, we can say that the innate assumes a very particular figure, since it\nis\n\ninseparable from a movement of decoding and passes to the margins of the\n\ncode, unlike the innate of the interior milieu; acquisition also assumes a\n\nvery particular figure, since it is territorialized, in other words, regulated\n\nby matters of expression rather than by stimuli in the exterior milieu. The\n\nnatal is the innate, but decoded; and it is the acquired, but territorialized.\n\nThe natal is the new figure assumed by the innate and the acquired in the\n\nterritorial assemblage. The affect proper to the natal, as heard in the lied:\nto\n\nbe forever lost, or refound, or aspiring to the unknown homeland. In the\n\nnatal, the innate tends to be displaced: as Ruyer says, it is in some way\n_prior  \nto _or _downstream from _the act; it concerns less the act or the behavior\nthan\n\nthe matters of expression themselves, the perception that discerns and\n\nselects them, and the gesture that erects them, or itself constitutes them\n\n(that is why there are \"critical periods\" when the animal valorizes an object\n\nor situation, \"is impregnated\" by a matter of expression, long before being\n\nable to perform the corresponding act). This is not to say, however, that\n\nbehavior is at the mercy of chance learning; for it is predetermined by this\n\ndisplacement, and finds rules of assemblage in its own territorialization.\n\nThe natal, then, consists in a decoding of innateness and a territo-\n\nrialization of learning, one atop the other, one alongside the other. The\n\nnatal has a consistency that cannot be explained as a mixture of the innate\n\nand the acquired, because it is instead what accounts for such mixtures in\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)355.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 333\n\nterritorial assemblage and interassemblages. In short, the notion of behav-\n\nior proves inadequate, too linear, in comparison with that of the assem-\n\nblage. The natal stretches from what happens in the intra-assemblage all\n\nthe way to the center that has been projected outside; it cuts across all the\n\ninterassemblages and reaches all the way to the gates of the Cosmos.\n\nThe territorial assemblage is inseparable from lines or coefficients of\n\ndeterritorialization, passages, and relays toward other assemblages. There\n\nhave been many studies on the influence of artificial conditions on bird\n\nsong, but the results vary both by species and according to the kind and\n\ntiming of the artifice. Many birds are receptive to the songs of other spe-\n\ncies, if they are exposed to them during the critical period, and will repro-\n\nduce the alien songs later on. The chaffinch, however, seems much more\n\ndevoted to its own matters of expression and retains an innate sense of its\n\nown tonal quality even if exposed to synthetic sounds. The outcome also\n\ndepends on whether the birds are isolated before or after the critical period.\n\nIn the first case, chaffinches develop a nearly normal song; in the second,\n\nthe subjects in the isolated group (who cannot hear each other) develop an\n\nabnormal, nonspecies-specific song that is nevertheless common to the\n\ngroup (see Thorpe). In any event, it is necessary to consider the effects of\n\ndeterritorialization or denatalization on a given species at a given moment.\n\nWhenever a territorial assemblage is taken up by a movement that\n\ndeterritorializes it (whether under so-called natural or artificial condi-\n\ntions), we say that a machine is released. That in fact is the distinction we\n\nwould like to propose between _machine _and _assemblage: _a machine is like a\n\nset of cutting edges that insert themselves into the assemblage undergoing\n\ndeterritorialization, and draw variations and mutations of it. For there are\n\nno mechanical effects; effects are always machinic, in other words, depend\n\non a machine that is plugged into an assemblage and has been freed\n\nthrough deterritorialization. What we call _machinic statements _are\n\nmachine effects that define consistency or enter matters of expression.\n\nEffects of this kind can be very diverse but are never symbolic or imagi-\n\nnary; they always have a real value of passage or relay.\n\nAs a general rule, a machine plugs into the territorial assemblage of a\n\nspecies and opens it to other assemblages, causes it to pass through the\n\ninterassemblages of that species; for example, the territorial assemblage of\n\na bird species opens onto interassemblages of courtship and\n\ngregar-iousness, moving in the direction of the partner or \"socius.\" But\n\nthe machine may also open the territorial assemblage to interspecific\n\nassemblages, as in the case of birds that adopt alien songs, and most\n\nespecially in the case of parasitism.\n\n37\n\nOr it may go beyond all assemblages\n\nand produce an opening onto the Cosmos.

It is\n\nimportant to bring up this \"black hole\" function again because it can\n\nincrease our understanding of phenomena of inhibition, and is in turn\n\ncapable of breaking with the overnarrow inhibitor-releaser dualism. We\n\nsaw earlier that an interassemblage could include lines of impoverishment\n\nand fixation leading to a black hole but could still perhaps lead into a\nricher\n\nand more positive line of deterritorialization (for example, the \"grass\n\nstem\" component among Australian grass finches falls into a black hole\n\nand leads into the \"refrain\" component).\n\n38\n\nThus the black hole is a\n\nmachine effect in assemblages and has a complex relation to other effects.\n\nIt may be necessary for the release of innovative processes that they first\n\nfall into a catastrophic black hole: stases of inhibition are associated with\n\nthe release of crossroads behaviors. On the other hand, when black holes\n\nresonate together or inhibitions conjugate and echo each other, instead of\n\nan opening onto consistency, we see a closure of the assemblage, as though\n\nit were deterritorialized in the void: young chaffinches. _Machines are  \nalways singular keys that open or close an assemblage, a territory. _More-\n\nover, finding the machine in operation in a given territorial assemblage is\n\nnot enough; it is already in operation in the emergence of matters of expres-\n\nsion, in other words, in the constitution of the assemblage and in the vec-\n\ntors of deterritorialization that ply it from the start.\n\nThus consistency of matters of expression relates, on the one hand, to\n\ntheir aptitude to form melodic and rhythmic themes and, on the other\n\nhand, to the power of the natal. Finally, there is one other aspect: their\nvery\n\nspecial relation to the molecular (the machine starts us down this road).\n\nThe very words, \"matters of expression,\" imply that expression has a pri-\n\nmary relation to matter. As matters of expression take on consistency they\n\nconstitute semiotic systems, but the _semiotic _components are inseparable\n\nfrom _material _components and are in exceptionally close contact with\n\nmolecular levels. The whole question is thus whether or not the\n\nmolar-molecular relation assumes a new figure here. In general, it has been\n\npossible to distinguish \"molar-molecular\" combinations that vary greatly\n\ndepending on the direction followed. First, individual atoms can enter into\n\nprobabilistic or statistical accumulations that tend to efface their individu-\n\nality; this already happens on the level of the molecule, and then again in\n\nthe molar aggregate. But they can become complicated in interactions and\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)357.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN D 335\n\nretain their individuality inside the molecule, then in the macromolecule,\n\netc., setting up direct communications between individuals of different\n\norders.\n\n39\n\nSecond, it is clear that the distinction to be made is not between\n\nthe individual and the statistical. In fact, it is always a question of\npopula-\n\ntions; statistics concerns individual phenomena, and antistatistical indi-\n\nviduality operates only in relation to molecular populations. The distinc-\n\ntion is between two group movements, as in Alembert's equation, in which\n\none group tends toward increasingly equilibrated, homogeneous, and\n\nprobable states (the divergent wave and the delayed potential), and the\n\nother group tends toward less probable states of concentration (the conver-\n\ngent wave and the anticipated potential).\n\n40\n\nThird, the intramolecular inter-\n\nnal forces that give an aggregate its molar form can be of two types: they are\n\neither covalent, arborescent, mechanical, linear, localizable relations sub-\n\nject to chemical conditions of action and reaction or to linked reactions, or\n\nthey are indirect, noncovalent, machinic and nonmechanical, superlinear,\n\nnonlocalizable bonds operating by stereospecific _discernment or discrimi-  \nnation, _rather than by linkage.\n\n41\n\nThese are different ways of stating the same distinction, which seems\n\nmuch broader than the one we are looking for: it is, in effect, a distinction\n\nbetween matter and life, or rather, since there is only one matter, between\n\ntwo states, two tendencies of atomic matter (for example, there are bonds\n\nthat immobilize the linked atoms in relation to one another, and other\n\nbonds that allow free rotation). Stating the distinction in the most general\n\nway, we could say that it is between stratified systems or systems of\nstratifi-\n\ncation on the one hand, and consistent, self-consistent aggregates on the\n\nother. But the point is that consistency, far from being restricted to com-\n\nplex life forms, fully pertains even to the most elementary atoms and parti-\n\ncles. There is a coded system of stratification whenever, horizontally, there\n\nare linear causalities between elements; and, vertically, hierarchies of order\n\nbetween groupings; and, holding it all together in depth, a succession of\n\nframing forms, each of which informs a substance and in turn serves as a\n\nsubstance for another form. These causalities, hierarchies, and framings\n\nconstitute a stratum, as well as the passage from one stratum to another,\n\nand the stratified combinations of the molecular and molar. On the other\n\nhand, we may speak of aggregates of consistency when instead of a regu-\n\nlated succession of forms-substances we are presented with consolidations\n\nof very heterogeneous elements, orders that have been short-circuited or\n\neven reverse causalities, and captures between materials and forces of a dif-\n\nferent nature: as if a _machinic phylum, a destratifying transversality,\n_moved\n\nthrough elements, orders, forms and substances, the molar and the molec-\n\nular, freeing a matter and tapping forces.\n\nNow if we ask ourselves where life fits into this distinction, we see that it\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)358.png)\n\n0\n\n336 D\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\nundoubtedly implies a gain in consistency, in other words, a surplus value\n\n(surplus value of _destratificatiori). _For example, it contains a greater\nnum-\n\nber of self-consistent aggregates and processes of consolidation and gives\n\nthem molar scope. It is destratifying from the outset, since its code is not\n\ndistributed throughout the entire stratum but rather occupies an eminently\n\nspecialized genetic line. But the question is almost contradictory, because\n\nasking where life fits in amounts to treating it as a particular stratum\n\nhaving its own order and befitting order, having its own forms and sub-\n\nstances. It is true that it is both at once: a particularly complex system of\n\nstratification and an aggregate of consistency that disrupts orders, forms,\n\nand substances. As we have seen, the living thing performs a transcoding of\n\nmilieus that can be considered both to constitute a stratum and to effect\n\nreverse causalities and transversals of destratification. The same question\n\ncan be asked when life no longer restricts itself to mixing milieus but\n\nassembles territories as well. The territorial assemblage implies a _decoding\n_\n\nand is inseparable from its own _deterritorialization _(two new types of sur-\n\nplus value). \"Ethology\" then can be understood as a very privileged molar\n\ndomain for demonstrating how the most varied components (biochemical,\n\nbehavioral, perceptive, hereditary, acquired, improvised, social, etc.) can\n\ncrystallize in assemblages that respect neither the distinction between\n\norders nor the hierarchy of forms. What holds all the components together\n\nare _transversals, _and the transversal itself is only a component that has\n\ntaken upon itself the specialized vector of deterritorialization. In effect,\n\nwhat holds an assemblage together is not the play of framing forms or linear\n\ncausalities but, actually or potentially, its most deterritorialized compo-\n\nnent, a cutting edge of deterritorialization. An example is the refrain: it is\n\nmore deterritorialized than the grass stem, but this does not preclude its\n\nbeing \"determined,\" in other words, connected to biochemical and molec-\n\nular components. The assemblage holds by its most deterritorialized com-\n\nponent, but deterritorialized is not the same as indeterminate (the refrain\n\nmay be narrowly connected to the presence of male hormones).\n\n42\n\nA compo-\n\nnent of this kind entering an assemblage may be among the most highly\n\ndetermined, even mechanized, of components, but it will still bring \"play\"\n\nto what it composes; it fosters the entry of new dimensions of the milieus by\n\nreleasing processes of discernibility, specialization, contraction, and accel-\n\neration that open new possibilities, that open the territorial assemblage\n\nonto interassemblages. Back to the stagemaker: one of its acts consists in\n\ndiscerning and causing to be discerned both sides of the leaf. This act is\n\nconnected to the determinism of the \"toothed\" beak.

But once again, this\n\nopposition is only relative, entirely relative. Just as milieus swing between\n\na stratum state and a movement of destratification, assemblages swing\n\nbetween a territorial closure that tends to restratify them and a\n\ndeterrito-rializing movement that on the contrary connects them with the\n\nCosmos. Thus it is not surprising that the distinction we were seeking\n\nwas not between assemblages and something else but between the two\n\nlimits of any possible assemblage, in other words, between the system of\n\nstrata and the plane of consistency. We should not forget that the strata\n\nrigidify and are organized on the plane of consistency, and that the plane\n\nof consistency is at work and is constructed in the strata, in both cases\n\npiece by piece, blow by blow, operation by operation.\n\nWe have gone from stratified milieus to territorialized assemblages and\n\nsimultaneously, from the forces of chaos, as broken down, coded,\n\ntrans-coded by the milieus, to the forces of the earth, as gathered into the\n\nassemblages. Then we went from territorial assemblages to\n\ninterassemblages, to' the opening of assemblages along lines of\n\ndeterritorialization; and simultaneously, the same from the ingathered\n\nforces of the earth to the deterritorialized, or rather deterritorializing,\n\nCosmos. How does Paul Klee present this last movement, which is not a\n\nterrestrial \"pace\" but instead a cosmic \"breakaway\" _[echappee: _also\n\n\"opening,\" \"outlet,\" \"vista\"; in counterpoint, \"escape tone\"\u2014Trans.]?

We began over there in the Bauhaus.... More we cannot\n\ndo.\"\n\n44\n\nClassicism refers to form-matter relation, or rather a form-substance\n\nrelation (substance is precisely a matter endowed with form). Matter is\n\norganized by a succession of forms that are compartmentalized, central-\n\nized, and hierarchized in relation to one another, each of which takes\n\ncharge of a greater or lesser amount of matter. Each form is like the code of\n\na milieu, and the passage from one form to another is a veritable\n\ntranscoding. Even the seasons are milieus. Two coexistent operations are\n\ninvolved, one by which the form differentiates itself according to binary\n\ndistinctions, the other by which the formed substantial parts, milieus or\n\nseasons, enter into an order of succession that can be the same in either\n\ndirection. But beneath these operations, the classical artist hazards an\n\nextreme and dangerous adventure. He or she breaks down the milieus,\n\nseparates them, harmonizes them, regulates their mixtures, passes from\n\none to the other. What the artist confronts in this way is chaos, the forces\n\nof chaos, the forces of a raw and untamed matter upon which Forms must\n\nbe imposed in order to make substances, and Codes in order to make\n\nmilieus. Phenomenal agility. That is why no one has ever been able to\n\ndraw a clear line between baroque and classical.\n\n45\n\nAll of baroque lies\n\nbrewing beneath classicism: the task of the classical artist is God's own,\n\nthat of organizing chaos; and the artist's only cry is Creation! Creation!\n\nThe Tree of Creation! An ancient wooden flute organizes chaos, but chaos\n\nreigns like the Queen of the Night. The classical artist proceeds with a\n\nOne-Two: the one-two of the differentiation of form divided\n\n(man-woman, masculine and feminine rhythms, voices, families of instru-\n\nments, all the binarities of the _ars nova); _and the one-two of the\n\ndistinction between parts as they answer each other (the enchanted flute\n\nand the magic bell). The little tune, the bird refrain, is the binary unity of\n\ncreation, the differentiating unity of the pure beginning: \"At first the\n\npiano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard\n\nand answered it, as from a neighboring tree. It was as at the beginning of\n\nthe world, as if there were as yet only the two of them on earth, _or\nrather_in\n\nthis world closed to all the rest, fashioned by the logic of a creator, in\n\nwhich there would never be more than the two of them: this sonata.\"\n\n46\n\nIf we attempt an equally summary definition of romanticism, we see\n\nthat everything is clearly different. A new cry resounds: the Earth, the\nterri-\n\ntory and the Earth! With romanticism, the artist abandons the ambition of\n\nde jure universality and his or her status as creator: the artist\nterritorializes,\n\nenters a territorial assemblage. The seasons are now territorialized. The\n\nearth is certainly not the same thing as the territory. The earth is the\nintense\n\npoint at the deepest level of the territory or is projected outside it like a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)361.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN D 339\n\nfocal point, where all the forces draw together in close embrace. The earth\n\nis no longer one force among others, nor is it a substance endowed with\n\nform or a coded milieu, with bounds and an apportioned share. The earth\n\nhas become that close embrace of all forces, those of the earth as well as of\n\nother substances, so that the artist no longer confronts chaos, but hell and\n\nthe subterranean, the groundless. The artist no longer risks dissipation in\n\nthe milieus but rather sinking too deeply into the earth: Empedocles. The\n\nartist no longer identifies with Creation but with the ground or foundation,\n\nthe foundation has become creative. The artist is no longer God but the\n\nHero who defies God: Found, Found, instead of Create. Faust, especially\n\nthe second Faust, is impelled by this tendency. Criticism, the Protestant-\n\nism of the earth, replaces dogmatism, the Catholicism of the milieus\n\n(code). It is certain that the Earth as an intense point in depth or in\nprojec-\n\ntion, as _ratio essendi, _is always in disjunction with the territory; and the\nter-\n\nritory as the condition of \"knowledge,\" _ratio cognoscendi, _is always in\n\ndisjunction with the earth. The territory is German, the Earth Greek. And\n\nthis disjunction is precisely what determines the status of the romantic art-\n\nist, in that she or he no longer confronts the gaping of chaos but the pull of\n\nthe Ground _(Fond). _The little tune, the bird refrain, has changed: it is no\n\nlonger the beginning of a world but draws a territorial assemblage upon the\n\nearth. It is then no longer made of two consonant parts that seek and answer\n\none another; it addresses itself to a deeper singing that founds it, but also\n\nstrikes against it and sweeps it away, making it ring dissonant. The refrain\nis\n\nindissolubly constituted by the territorial song and the singing of the earth\n\nthat rises to drown it out. Thus at the end of _Das Lied von der Erde _(The\n\nsong of the Earth) there are two coexistent motifs, one melodic, evoking the\n\nassemblages of the bird, the other rhythmic, evoking the deep, eternal\n\nbreathing of the earth. Mahler says that the singing of the birds, the color\nof\n\nthe flowers, and the fragrance of the forest are not enough to make Nature,\n\nthat the god Dionysus and the great Pan are needed. The Ur-refrain of the\n\nearth harnesses all refrains whether territorial or not, and all milieu\n\nrefrains. By the end of [Berg's] _Wozzeck, _the lullaby refrain, military\n\nrefrain, drinking refrain, hunting refrain, child's refrain are so many admi-\n\nrable assemblages swept up by the powerful earth machine and its cutting\n\nedges: Wozzeck's voice, by which the earth becomes sonorous, Marie's\n\ndeath cry moving over the pond, the repeated B note, when the earth\n\nhowled ... It is owing to this disjunction, this decoding, that the romantic\n\nartist experiences the territory; but he or she experiences it as necessarily\n\nlost, and experiences him- or herself as an exile, a voyager, as\n\ndeterrito-rialized, _driven back into the milieus, _like the Flying Dutchman\n\nor King Waldemar (whereas the classical artist inhabited the milieus).

The signpost now only indicates\n\nthe road of no return. This is the ambiguity of the natal, as it appears in\nthe\n\nlied (as well as in symphony and opera): the lied is simultaneously the terri-\n\ntory, the lost territory, and the earth vector. The intermezzo assumed\n\nincreasing importance because it played on all the disjunctions between\n\nthe earth and the territory, inserted itself into them, filled them after its\n\nfashion, \"between night and day,\" \"noon-midnight.\" From this standpoint,\n\nthe fundamental innovations of romanticism can be said to be the\n\nfollowing: There were no longer substantial parts corresponding to forms,\n\nmilieus corresponding to codes, or a matter in chaos given order in forms\n\nand by codes. The parts were instead like assemblages produced and dis-\n\nmantled at the surface. Form itself became _a great form in continuous devel-  \nopment, _a gathering of the forces of the earth taking all the parts up into a\n\nsheaf. Matter itself was no longer a chaos to subjugate and organize but\n\nrather _the moving matter of a continuous variation. _The universal had\n\nbecome a relation, variation. The continuous variation of matter and the\n\ncontinuous development of form. The assemblages thus placed matter and\n\nform in a new relation: matter ceased to be a matter of content, becoming\n\ninstead a matter of expression, and form ceased to be a code subduing the\n\nforces of chaos, becoming a force itself, the sum of the forces of the earth.\n\nThere was a new relation to danger, madness, limits: romanticism did not\n\ngo further than baroque classicism; it went elsewhere, with other givens\n\nand other vectors.\n\nWhat romanticism lacks most is a people. The territory is haunted by a\n\nsolitary voice; the voice of the earth resonates with it and provides it per-\n\ncussion rather than answering it. Even when there is a people, it is\n\nmediatized by the earth, it rises up from the bowels of the earth and is apt\nto\n\nreturn there: more a subterranean than a terrestrial people. The hero is a\n\nhero of the earth; he is mythic, rather than being a hero of the people and\n\nhistorical. Germany, German romanticism, had a genius for experiencing\n\nthe natal territory not as deserted but as \"solitary,\" regardless of popula-\n\ntion density; for the population is only an emanation of the earth, and has\n\nthe value of One Alone. The territory does not open onto a people, it\n\nhalf-opens onto the Friend, the Loved One; but the Loved One is already\n\ndead, and the Friend uncertain, disturbing.\n\n47\n\nAs in the lied, everything in the\n\nterritory occurs in relation to the One-Alone of the soul and the One-All of\n\nthe earth. That is why romanticism takes on an entirely different aspect\n\nand even claims a different name, a different placard, in the Latin and\n\nSlavic countries, where on the contrary everything is put in terms of the\n\ntheme of a people and the forces of a people. This time, it is the earth that\n\nis mediatized by the people, and exists only through the people. This\n\ntime, the earth can be \"deserted,\" an arid steppe, or a ravaged,\n\ndismembered ter-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)363.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 341\n\nritory; yet it is never solitary, it is always filled by a nomadic population\n\nthat divides or regroups, contests or laments, attacks or suffers. This time,\n\nthe hero is a hero of the people, and not of the earth; her is related to the  \n_One-Crowd, _not the _One-All. _It certainly cannot be said that there is more\nor\n\nless nationalism on one side or the other because nationalism is everywhere\n\nin the figures of romanticism, sometimes as the driving force, sometimes as\n\na black hole (fascism used Verdi much less than nazism did Wagner). The\n\nproblem is a truly musical one, technically musical, and all the more politi-\n\ncal for that. The romantic hero, the voice of the romantic hero, acts as a\n\nsubject, a subjectified individual with \"feelings\"; but this subjective vocal\n\nelement is reflected in an orchestral and instrumental whole that on the\n\ncontrary mobilizes nonsubjective \"affects\" and that reaches its height in\n\nromanticism. It should not be thought that the vocal element and the\n\norchestral-instrumental whole are only in an extrinsic relation to one\n\nanother: the orchestration imposes a given role on the voice, and the voice\n\nenvelops a given mode of orchestration. Orchestration-instrumentation\n\nbrings sound forces together or separates them, gathers or disperses them;\n\nbut it changes, and the role of the voice changes too, depending on whether\n\nthe forces are of the Earth or of the People, of the One-All or the\n\nOne-Crowd. In the first case, it is a question of effecting _grouping of\npowers, _\n\nand these are what constitute affects; in the second case, it is _group  \nindividuations _that constitute affect and are the object of orchestration.\n\nGroupings of power are fully diversified, but they are like _the relations  \nproper to the Universal; _we must use another word, the _Dividual, _to desig-\n\nnate the type of musical relations and the intra- or intergroup passages\n\noccurring in group individuation. The sentimental or subjective element\n\nof the voice has a different role and even a different position depending on\n\nwhether it internally confronts nonsubjectified groupings of power or\n\nnonsubjectified group individuation, the relations of the universal or the\n\nrelations of the \"dividual.\" Debussy formulated the problem of the\n\nOne-Crowd well when he reproached Wagner for not knowing how to \"do\"\n\na crowd or a people: a crowd must be fully individuated, but by group\n\nindividuations that are not reducible to the individuality of the subjects\n\nthat compose the crowd.\n\n48\n\nThe people must be individualized, not according\n\nto the persons within it, but according to the affects it experiences,\n\nsimultaneously or successively. The concepts of the One-Crowd and the\n\nDividual are botched if the people is reduced to a juxtaposition, or if it is\n\nreduced to a power of the universal. In short, there are two very different\n\nconceptions of orchestration, depending on whether one is seeking to\n\nsonorize the forces of the Earth or the forces of the People. The simplest\n\nexample of this difference is doubtless Wagner-Verdi, in that Verdi puts\n\nincreasing emphasis on the relations between the voice and instrumenta-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)364.png)\n\n0\n\n342 D\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\ntion and orchestration. Even today, Stockhausen and Berio outline a new\n\nversion of this difference, even though they are grappling with a musical\n\nproblem different from that of romanticism (in Berio there is a search for a\n\nmultiple cry, a cry of the population, in the dividual of the One-Crowd, and\n\nnot for a cry of the Earth in the universal of the One-All). The idea of an\n\nOpera of the world, or cosmic music, changes drastically depending on\n\nwhich pole of orchestration is in play.\n\n49\n\nTo avoid an oversimplified opposi-\n\ntion between Wagner and Verdi, we would have to show how Berlioz had a\n\ngenius for passing from one pole to the other in his orchestration, or even\n\nhesitating between them: a sonorous Nature _or _People. And how music like\n\nMussorgsky's was able to do a crowd (despite what Debussy says). And how\n\nmusic like Bartok's was able to use popular, or population, airs to do popu-\n\nlations, themselves sonorous, instrumental, and orchestral, which impose\n\na Dividual scale, a prodigious new chromaticism.\n\n50\n\nAnd then there are all\n\nthe non-Wagnerian paths ...\n\nIf there is a modern age, it is, of course, the age of the cosmic. Paul Klee\n\ndeclared himself anti-Faustian. \"As for animals and all the other creatures,\n\nI do not like them with a terrestrial cordiality; earthly things interest me\n\nless than cosmic things.\" The assemblage no longer confronts the forces of\n\nchaos, it no longer uses the forces of the earth or the people to deepen\nitself\n\nbut instead opens onto the forces of the Cosmos. All this seems extremely\n\ngeneral, and somewhat Hegelian, testifying to an absolute Spirit. Yet it is,\n\nshould be, a question of technique, exclusively a question of technique.\n\nThe essential relation is no longer matters-forms (or substances-attri-\n\nbutes); neither is it the continuous development of form and the continu-\n\nous variation of matter. It is now a direct relation _material-forces. _A\n\nmaterial is a molecularized matter, which must accordingly \"harness\"\n\nforces; these forces are necessarily forces of the Cosmos. There is no longer\n\na matter that finds its corresponding principle of intelligibility in form. It\nis\n\nnow a question of elaborating a material charged with harnessing forces of\n\na different order: the visual material must capture nonvisible forces. _Ren-  \nder visible, _Klee said; not render or reproduce the visible. From this per-\n\nspective, philosophy follows the same movement as the other activities;\n\nwhereas romantic philosophy still appealed to a formal synthetic identity\n\nensuring a continuous intelligibility of matter (a priori synthesis), modern\n\nphilosophy tends to elaborate a material of thought in order to capture\n\nforces that are not thinkable in themselves. This is Cosmos philosophy,\n\nafter the manner of Nietzsche. The molecular material has even become so\n\ndeterritorialized that we can no longer even speak of matters of expression,\n\nas we did in romantic territoriality. _Matters of expression are superseded by  \na material of capture. _The forces to be captured are no longer those of the\n\nearth, which still constitute a great expressive Form, but the forces of an\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)365.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN \u25a1 343\n\nimmaterial, nonformal, and energetic Cosmos.

Perhaps it is not until Cezanne that rocks begin to\n\nexist uniquely through the forces of folding they harness, landscapes\n\nthrough thermal and magnetic forces, and apples through forces of germi-\n\nnation: nonvisual forces that nevertheless have been rendered visible.\n\nWhen forces become necessarily cosmic, material becomes necessarily\n\nmolecular, with enormous force operating in an infinitesimal space. The\n\nproblem is no longer that of the beginning, any more than it is that of a\n\nfoundation-ground. It is now a problem of consistency or consolidation:\n\nhow to consolidate the material, make it consistent, so that it can harness\n\nunthinkable, invisible, nonsonorous forces. Debussy ... Music\n\nmolecu-larizes sound matter and in so doing becomes capable of\n\nharnessing nonsonorous forces such as Duration and Intensity.\n\n51\n\n_Render _\n\n_Duration sonorous. _Let us recall Nietzsche's idea of the eternal return as a\n\nlittle ditty, a refrain, but which captures the mute and unthinkable forces\n\nof the Cosmos. We thus leave behind the assemblages to enter the age of the\n\nMachine, the immense mechanosphere, the plane of cosmicization of\n\nforces to be harnessed. Varese's procedure, at the dawn of this age, is\n\nexemplary: a musical machine of consistency, a _sound machine _(not a\n\nmachine for reproducing sounds), which molecularizes and atomizes,\n\nionizes sound matter, and harnesses a cosmic energy.\n\n52\n\nIf this machine must\n\nhave an assemblage, it is the synthesizer. By assembling modules, source\n\nelements, and elements for treating sound (oscillators, generators, and\n\ntransformers), by arranging microintervals, the synthesizer makes audible\n\nthe sound process itself, the production of that process, and puts us in\n\ncontact with still other elements beyond sound matter.\n\n53\n\nIt unites disparate\n\nelements in the material, and transposes the parameters from one formula\n\nto another. The synthesizer, with its operation of consistency, has taken the\n\nplace of the ground in a priori synthetic judgment: its synthesis is of the\n\nmolecular and the cosmic, material and force, not form and matter, _Grund _\n\nand territory. Philosophy is no longer synthetic judgment; it is like a\n\nthought synthesizer functioning to make thought travel, make it mobile,\n\nmake it a force of the Cosmos (in the same way as one makes sound\n\ntravel).\n\nThis synthesis of disparate elements is not without ambiguity. It has the\n\nsame ambiguity, perhaps, as the modern valorization of children's draw-\n\nings, texts by the mad, and concerts of noise.

All one has left is\n\na resonance chamber well on the way to forming a black hole. A material\n\nthat is too rich remains too \"territorialized\": on noise sources, on the\n\nnature of the objects ... (this even applies to Cage's prepared piano). One\n\nmakes an aggregate fuzzy, instead of defining the fuzzy aggregate _by _the\n\noperations of consistency or consolidation pertaining to it. For this is the\n\nessential thing: _a fuzzy aggregate, a synthesis of disparate elements, is  \ndefined only by a degree of consistency that makes it possible to distinguish  \nthe disparate elements constituting that aggregate (discernibility) _,\n\n54\n\nThe\n\nmaterial must be sufficiently deterritorialized to be molecularized and\n\nopen onto something cosmic, instead of lapsing into a statistical heap. This\n\ncondition is met only if there is a certain simplicity in the nonuniform\n\nmaterial: a maximum of calculated sobriety in relation to the disparate ele-\n\nments and the parameters. The sobriety of the assemblages is what makes\n\nfor the richness of the Machine's effects. People often have too much of a\n\ntendency to reterritorialize on the child, the mad, noise. If this is done,\none  \n_fuzzifies _instead of making the fuzzy aggregate consist, or harnessing cos-\n\nmic forces in the deterritorialized material. That is why it infuriated Paul\n\nKlee when people would talk about the \"childishness\" of his drawings (and\n\nVarese when they would talk about sound effects, etc.). According to Klee,\n\nwhat is needed in order to \"render visible\" or harness the Cosmos is a pure\n\nand simple line accompanied by the idea of an object, and nothing more: if\n\nyou multiply the lines and take the whole object, you get nothing but a\n\nscramble, and visual sound effects.\n\n55\n\nAccording to Varese, in order for the\n\nprojection to yield a highly complex form, in other words, a cosmic distri-\n\nbution, what is necessary is a simple figure in motion and a plane that is\n\nitself mobile; otherwise, you get sound effects. Sobriety, sobriety: that is\nthe\n\ncommon prerequisite for the deterritorialization of matters, the\n\nmolecu-larization of material, and the cosmicization of forces. Maybe a\n\nchild can do that. But the sobriety involved is the sobriety of a\n\nbecoming-child that is not necessarily the becoming o/the child, quite the\n\ncontrary; the becoming-mad involved is not necessarily the becoming _of _\n\n'the madman, quite the contrary. It is clear that what is necessary to make\n\nsound travel, and to travel around sound, is very pure and simple sound,\n\nan emission or wave without harmonics (La Monte Young has been\n\nsuccessful at this).

To be an artisan and no longer an artist, cre-\n\nator, or founder, is the only way to become cosmic, to leave the milieus and\n\nthe earth behind. The invocation to the Cosmos does not at all operate as a\n\nmetaphor; on the contrary, the operation is an effective one, from the\n\nmoment the artist connects a material with forces of consistency or\n\nconsolidation.\n\nMaterial thus has three principal characteristics: it is a molecularized\n\nmatter; it has a relation to forces to be harnessed; and it is defined by the\n\noperations of consistency applied to it. Finally, it is clear that the\nrelation to\n\nthe earth and the people has changed, and is no longer of the romantic type.\n\nThe earth is now at its most deterritorialized: not only a point in a galaxy,\n\nbut one galaxy among others. The people is now at its most molecularized:\n\na molecular population, a people of oscillators as so many forces of interac-\n\ntion. The artist discards romantic figures, relinquishes both the forces of\n\nthe earth and those of the people. The combat, if combat there is, has\n\nmoved. The established powers have occupied the earth, they have built\n\npeople's organizations. The mass media, the great people's organizations\n\nof the party or union type, are machines for reproduction, fuzzification\n\nmachines that effectively scramble all the terrestrial forces of the people.\n\nThe established powers have placed us in the situation of a combat at once\n\natomic and cosmic, galactic. Many artists became aware of this situation\n\nlong ago, even before it had been installed (Nietzsche, for example). They\n\nbecame aware of it because the same vector was traversing their own\n\ndomain: a molecularization, an atomization of the material, coupled with\n\na cosmicization of the forces taken up by that material. The question then\n\nbecame whether molecular or atomic \"populations\" of all natures (mass\n\nmedia, monitoring procedures, computers, space weapons) would con-\n\ntinue to bombard the existing people in order to train it or control it or\n\nannihilate it\u2014or if other molecular populations were possible, could slip\n\ninto the first and give rise to a people yet to come. As Virilio says in his\nvery\n\nrigorous analysis of the depopulation of the people and the\n\ndeterrito-rialization of the earth, the question has become: \"To dwell as a\n\npoet or as an assassin?\"\n\n56\n\nThe assassin is one who bombards the existing\n\npeople with molecular populations that are forever closing all of the\n\nassemblages, hurling them into an ever wider and deeper black hole. The\n\npoet, on the other hand, is one who lets loose molecular populations in\n\nhopes that this will sow the seeds of, or even engender, the people to\n\ncome, that these populations will pass into a people to come, open a\n\ncosmos.

In this\n\nrespect, the relation of artists to the people has changed significantly: the\n\nartist has ceased to be the One-Alone withdrawn into him- or herself, but\n\nhas also ceased to address the people, to invoke the people as a constituted\n\nforce. Never has the artist been more in need of a people, while stating most\n\nfirmly that the people is lacking\u2014the people is what is most lacking. We\n\nare not referring to popular or populist artists. Mallarme said that the Book\n\nneeded a people. Kafka said that literature is the affair of the people. Klee\n\nsaid that the people is essential _yet lacking. _Thus the problem of the\nartist is\n\nthat the modern depopulation of the people results in an open earth, and by\n\nmeans of art, or by means to which art contributes. Instead of being bom-\n\nbarded from all sides in a limiting cosmos, the people and the earth must be\n\nlike the vectors of a cosmos that carries them off; then the cosmos itself\nwill\n\nbe art. From depopulation, make a cosmic people; from\n\ndeterritorializa-tion, a cosmic earth\u2014that is the wish of the artisan-artist,\n\nhere, there, locally. Our governments deal with the molecular and the\n\ncosmic, and our arts make them their affair also, with the same stakes, the\n\npeople and the earth, and with unfortunately incomparable, but\n\nnevertheless competitive, means. Is it not of the nature of creations to\n\noperate in silence, locally, to seek consolidation everywhere, to go from the\n\nmolecular to an uncertain cosmos, whereas the processes of destruction\n\nand conservation work in bulk, take center stage, occupy the entire\n\ncosmos in order to enslave the molecular and to stick it in a conservatory\n\nor a bomb?\n\nThese three \"ages,\" the classical, romantic, and modern (for lack of a\n\nbetter term), should not be interpreted as an evolution, or as structures sep-\n\narated by signifying breaks. They are assemblages enveloping different\n\nMachines, or different relations to the Machine. In a sense, everything we\n\nattribute to an age was already present in the preceding age. Forces, for\n\nexample: it has always been a question of forces, designated either as forces\n\nof chaos or forces of the earth. Similarly, for all of time painting has had\nthe\n\nproject of rendering visible, instead of reproducing the visible, and music\n\nof rendering sonorous, instead of reproducing the sonorous. Fuzzy aggre-\n\ngates have been constituting themselves and inventing their processes of\n\nconsolidation all along. _A freeing of the molecular _was already found in\n\nclassical matters of content, operating by destratification, and in romantic\n\nmatters of expression, operating by decoding. The most we can say is that\n\nwhen forces appear as forces of the earth or of chaos, they are not grasped\n\ndirectly as forces but as reflected in relations between matter and form.\n\nThus it is more a question of thresholds of perception, or thresholds of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)369.png)\n\n0\n\n1837:\n\nOF THE REFRAIN D 347\n\ndiscernibility belonging to given assemblages. It is only after matter has\n\nbeen sufficiently deterritorialized that it itself emerges as molecular and\n\nbrings forth pure forces attributable only to the Cosmos. It had been pres-\n\nent \"for all of time,\" but under different perceptual conditions. New condi-\n\ntions were necessary for what was buried or covered, inferred or con-\n\ncluded, presently to rise to the surface. What was composed in an\n\nassemblage, what was still only composed, becomes a component of a new\n\nassemblage. In this sense, all history is really the history of perception,\nand\n\nwhat we make history with is the matter of a becoming, not the subject mat-\n\nter of a story. Becoming is like the machine: present in a different way in\n\nevery assemblage, passing from one to the other, opening one onto the\n\nother, outside any fixed order or determined sequence.\n\nWe are now ready to return to the refrain. We can propose a new classifi-\n\ncation system: milieu refrains, with at least two parts, one of which answers\n\nthe other (the piano and the violin); natal refrains, refrains of the\nterritory,\n\nwhere the part is related to the whole, to an immense refrain of the earth,\n\naccording to relations that are themselves variable and mark in each\n\ninstance the disjunction between the earth and the territory (the lullaby,\n\nthe drinking song, hunting song, work song, military song, etc.); folk and\n\npopular refrains, themselves tied to an immense song of the people,\n\naccording to variable relations of crowd individuations that simultane-\n\nously bring into play affects and nations (the Polish, Auvergnat, German,\n\nMagyar, or Romanian, but also the Pathetic, Panicked, Vengeful, etc.);\n\nmolecularized refrains (the sea and the wind) tied to cosmic forces, the\n\nCosmos refrain. For the Cosmos itself is a refrain, and the ear also (every-\n\nthing that has been taken for a labyrinth is in fact a refrain). But precisely\n\nwhy is the refrain eminently sonorous? Why this privileging of the ear,\n\nwhen even animals and birds present us with so many visual, chromatic,\n\npostural, and gestural refrains? Does the painter have fewer refrains than\n\nthe musician? Are there fewer refrains in Cezanne or Klee than in Mozart,\n\nSchumann, or Debussy? Taking Proust's examples: Does Vermeer's little\n\nyellow span of wall, or a painter's flowers, Elstir's roses, constitute less\nof a\n\nrefrain than Vinteuil's little phrase? There is surely no question here of\n\ndeclaring a given art supreme on the basis of a formal hierarchy of absolute\n\ncriteria. Our problem is more modest: comparing the powers or coeffi-\n\ncients of deterritorialization of sonorous and visual components. It seems\n\nthat when sound deterritorializes, it becomes more and more refined; it\n\nbecomes specialized and autonomous. Color clings more, not necessarily\n\nto the object, but to territoriality. When it deterritorializes, it tends to\n\ndissolve, to let itself be steered by other components. This is evident in\n\nphenomena of synesthesia, which are not reducible to a simple color-sound\n\ncorrespondence; sounds have a piloting role and induce colors that _are_\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)370.png)\n\n0\n\n348 \u25a1\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\n_superposed _upon the colors we see, lending them a properly sonorous\n\nrhythm and movement.\n\n57\n\nSound owes this power not to signifying or\n\n\"communicational\" values (which on the contrary presuppose that pow-\n\ner), nor to physical properties (which would privilege light over sound),\n\nbut to a phylogenetic line, a machinic phylum that operates in sound and\n\nmakes it a cutting edge of deterritorialization. But this does not happen\n\nwithout great ambiguity: sound invades us, impels us, drags us,\n\ntranspierces us. It takes leave of the earth, as much in order to drop us into\na\n\nblack hole as to open us up to a cosmos. It makes us want to die. Since its\n\nforce of deterritorialization is the strongest, it also effects the most\nmassive\n\nof reterritorializations, the most numbing, the most redundant. Ecstasy\n\nand hypnosis. Colors do not move a people. Flags can do nothing without\n\ntrumpets. Lasers are modulated on sound. The refrain is sonorous par\n\nexcellence, but it can as easily develop its force into a sickly sweet ditty\nas\n\ninto the purest motif, or Vinteuil's little phrase. And sometimes the two\n\ncombine: Beethoven used as a \"signature tune.\" The potential fascism of\n\nmusic. Overall, we may say that music is plugged into a machinic phylum\n\ninfinitely more powerful than that of painting: a line of selective pressure.\n\nThat is why the musician has a different relation to the people, machines,\n\nand the established powers than does the painter. In particular, the estab-\n\nlished powers feel a keen need to control the distribution of black holes and\n\nlines of deterritorialization in this phylum of sounds, in order to ward off\n\nor appropriate the effects of musical machinism. Painters, at least as com-\n\nmonly portrayed, may be much more open socially, much more political,\n\nand less controlled from without and within. That is because each time\n\nthey paint, they must create or recreate a phylum, and they must do so on\n\nthe basis of bodies of light and color they themselves produce, whereas\n\nmusicians have at their disposal a kind of germinal continuity, even if it is\n\nlatent or indirect, on the basis of which they produce sound bodies. Two\n\ndifferent movements of creation: one goes from _soma _to _germen, _and the\n\nother from _germen _to _soma. _The painter's refrain is like the flipside of\nthe\n\nmusician's, a negative of music.\n\nSo just what is a refrain? _Glass harmonica: _the refrain is a prism, a crys-\n\ntal of space-time. It acts upon that which surrounds it, sound or light,\n\nextracting from it various vibrations, or decompositions, projections, or\n\ntransformations. The refrain also has a catalytic function: not only to\n\nincrease the speed of the exchanges and reactions in that which surrounds\n\nit, but also to assure indirect interactions between elements devoid of\n\nso-called natural affinity, and thereby to form organized masses. The\n\nrefrain is therefore of the crystal or protein type.

The\n\nambiguity of the refrain is more evident now: for if the retrograde motion\n\nmerely forms a closed circle, if the augmentations and diminutions are reg-\n\nular, proceeding, for example, by doubled or halved values, then this false\n\nspatiotemporal rigor leaves the exterior aggregate all the fuzzier; that\n\naggregate now has only descriptive, indicative, or associative relations\n\nwith the seed. It is \"a worksite of inauthentic elements for the formation of\n\nimpure crystals,\" rather than a pure crystal that harnesses cosmic forces.\n\nThe refrain remains a formula evoking a character or landscape, instead of\n\nitself constituting a rhythmic character or melodic landscape. The refrain\n\nhas two poles. These poles hinge not only on an intrinsic quality but also on\n\na state of force on the part of the listener; thus the little phrase from\n\nVinteuil's sonata is associated with Swann's love, the character of Odette,\n\nand the landscape of the Bois de Boulogne for a long time, until it turns\n\nback on itself, opens onto itself, revealing until then unheard-of potentiali-\n\nties, entering into other connections, setting love adrift in the direction of\n\nother assemblages. Here, Time is not an a priori form; rather, the refrain is\n\nthe a priori form of time, which in each case fabricates different times  \n_[temps: _also, \"meters,\" \"tempos\"\u2014Trans.].\n\nIt is odd how music does not eliminate the bad or mediocre refrain, or\n\nthe bad usage of the refrain, but on the contrary carries it along, or uses it\nas\n\na springboard. \"Ah, vous dirai-je maman\" (\"Ah, mamma, now you shall\n\nknow\"), \"Elle avait une jambe de bois\" (\"She had a wooden leg\"), \"Frere\n\nJacques.\" Childhood or bird refrain, folk song, drinking song, Viennese\n\nwaltz, cow bells: music uses anything and sweeps everything away. Not that\n\na folk song, bird song, or children's song is reducible to the kind of closed\n\nand associative formula we just mentioned. Instead, what needs to be\n\nshown is that a musician requires a _first type _of refrain, a territorial or\n\nassemblage refrain, in order to transform it from within, deterritorialize it,\n\nproducing a refrain of the _second type _as the final end of music: the cosmic\n\nrefrain of a sound machine. Gisele Brelet, discussing Bartok, gives a good\n\nformulation of the problem of the two types: beginning from popular and\n\nterritorial _melodies _that are autonomous, self-sufficient, and closed in\n\nupon themselves, how can one construct a new chromaticism that places\n\nthem in communication, thereby creating _\"themes\" _bringing about a devel-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)372.png)\n\n0\n\n350 \u25a1\n\n1837: OF THE REFRAIN\n\nopment of Form, or rather a becoming of Forces? The problem is a general\n\none because in many directions refrains will be planted by a new seed that\n\nbrings back modes, makes those modes communicate, undoes tempera-\n\nment, melds major and minor, and cuts the tonal system loose, slipping\n\nthrough its net instead of breaking with it.\n\n59\n\nWe may say long live Chabrier,\n\nas opposed to Schoenberg, just as Nietzsche said long live Bizet, and for the\n\nsame reasons, with the same technical and musical intent. We go from\n\nmodality to an untempered, widened chromaticism. We do not need to\n\nsuppress tonality, we need to turn it loose. We go from assembled refrains\n\n(territorial, popular, romantic, etc.) to the great cosmic machined refrain.\n\nBut the labor of creation is already under way in the first type; it is there\nin\n\nits entirety. Deformations destined to harness a great force are already\n\npresent in the small-form refrain or rondo. Childhood scenes, children's\n\ngames: the starting point is a childlike refrain, but the child has wings\n\nalready, he becomes celestial. The becoming-child of the musician is cou-\n\npled with a becoming-aerial of the child, in a nondecomposable block. The\n\nmemory of an angel, or rather the becoming of a cosmos.

Rather, he is like a pure and immeas-\n\nurable multiplicity, the pack, an irruption of the ephemeral and the power\n\nof metamorphosis. _He unties the bond just as he betrays the pact. _He brings  \n_a furor to _bear against sovereignty, a celerity against gravity, secrecy\nagainst\n\nthe public, a power _(puissance) _against sovereignty, a machine against the\n\napparatus. He bears witness to another kind of justice, one of incompre-\n\nhensible cruelty at times, but at others of unequaled pity as well (because he\n\nunties bonds.. .).\n\n4\n\nHe bears witness, above all, to other relations with\n\nwomen, with animals, because he sees all things in relations of _becoming, _\n\nrather than implementing binary distributions between \"states\": a verita-\n\nble becoming-animal of the warrior, a becoming-woman, which lies out-\n\nside dualities of terms as well as correspondences between relations. In\n\nevery respect, the war machine is of another species, another nature,\n\nanother origin than the State apparatus.\n\nLet us take a limited example and compare the war machine and the\n\nState apparatus in the context of the theory of games. Let us take chess and\n\nGo, from the standpoint of the game pieces, the relations between the\n\npieces and the space involved. Chess is a game of State, or of the court: the\n\nemperor of China played it. Chess pieces are coded; they have an internal\n\nnature and intrinsic properties from which their movements, situations,\n\nand confrontations derive. They have qualities; a knight remains a knight,\n\na pawn a pawn, a bishop a bishop. Each is like a subject of the statement\n\nendowed with a relative power, and these relative powers combine in a sub-\n\nject of enunciation, that is, the chess player or the game's form of\n\ninteriority. Go pieces, in contrast, are pellets, disks, simple arithmetic\n\nunits, and have only an anonymous, collective, or third-person function:\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)375.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 353\n\n\"It\" makes a move. \"It\" could be a man, a woman, a louse, an elephant. Go\n\npieces are elements of a nonsubjectified machine assemblage with no\n\nintrinsic properties, only situational ones. Thus the relations are very dif-\n\nferent in the two cases. Within their milieu of interiority, chess pieces\n\nentertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversary's\n\npieces: their functioning is structural. On the other hand, a Go piece has\n\nonly a milieu of exteriority, or extrinsic relations with nebulas or\nconstella-\n\ntions, according to which it fulfills functions of insertion or situation,\nsuch\n\nas bordering, encircling, shattering. All by itself, a Go piece can destroy an\n\nentire constellation synchronically; a chess piece cannot (or can do so\n\ndiachronically only). Chess is indeed a war, but an institutionalized, regu-\n\nlated, coded war, with a front, a rear, battles. But what is proper to Go is\nwar\n\nwithout battle lines, with neither confrontation nor retreat, without battles\n\neven: pure strategy, whereas chess is a semiology. Finally, the space is not\nat\n\nall the same: in chess, it is a question of arranging a closed space for\noneself,\n\nthus of going from one point to another, of occupying the maximum num-\n\nber of squares with the minimum number of pieces. In Go, it is a question\n\nof arraying oneself in an open space, of holding space, of maintaining the\n\npossibility of springing up at any point: the movement is not from one\n\npoint to another, but becomes perpetual, without aim or destination, with-\n\nout departure or arrival. The \"smooth\" space of Go, as against the \"stri-\n\nated\" space of chess. The _nomos _of Go against the State of chess, _nomos _\n\nagainst _polis. _The difference is that chess codes and decodes space, whereas\n\nGo proceeds altogether differently, territorializing or deterritorializing it\n\n(make the outside a territory in space; consolidate that territory by the con-\n\nstruction of a second, adjacent territory; deterritorialize the enemy by\n\nshattering his territory from within; deterritorialize oneself by renouncing,\n\nby going elsewhere . ..).

Dumezil analyzes the three \"sins\"\n\nof the warrior in the Indo-European tradition: against the king, against the\n\npriest, against the laws originating in the State (for example, a sexual\ntrans-\n\ngression that compromises the distribution of men and women, or even a\n\nbetrayal of the laws of war as instituted by the State).\n\n7\n\nThe warrior is in the\n\nposition of betraying everything, including the function of the military, _or\n_\n\nof understanding nothing. It happens that historians, both bourgeois and\n\nSoviet, will follow this negative tradition and explain how Genghis Khan\n\nunderstood nothing: he \"didn't understand\" the phenomenon of the city.\n\nAn easy thing to say. The problem is that the exteriority of the war machine\n\nin relation to the State apparatus is everywhere apparent but remains diffi-\n\ncult to conceptualize. It is not enough to affirm that the war machine is\n\nexternal to the apparatus. It is necessary to reach the point of conceiving\n\nthe war machine as itself a pure form of exteriority, whereas the State appa-\n\nratus constitutes the form of interiority we habitually take as a model, or\n\naccording to which we are in the habit of thinking. What complicates\n\neverything is that this extrinsic power of the war machine tends, under cer-\n\ntain circumstances, to become confused with one of the two heads of the\n\nState apparatus. Sometimes it is confused with the magic violence of the\n\nState, at other times with the State's military institution. For instance, the\n\nwar machine invents speed and secrecy; but there is all the same a certain\n\nspeed and a certain secrecy that pertain to the State, relatively,\nsecondarily.\n\nSo there is a great danger of identifying the structural relation between the\n\ntwo poles of political sovereignty, and the dynamic interrelation of these\n\ntwo poles, with the power of war. Dumezil cites the lineage of the Roman\n\nkings: there is a Romulus-Numa relation that recurs throughout a series,\n\nwith variants and an alternation between these two types of equally legiti-\n\nmate rulers; but there is also a relation with an \"evil king,\" Tullus\nHostilius,\n\nTarquinius Superbus, an upsurge of the warrior as a disquieting and illegit-\n\nimate character.\n\n8\n\nShakespeare's kings could also be invoked: even violence,\n\nmurders, and perversion do not prevent the State lineage from producing\n\n\"good\" kings; but a disturbing character like Richard III slips in, announc-\n\ning from the outset his intention to reinvent a war machine and impose its\n\nline (deformed, treacherous and traitorous, he claims a \"secret close\n\nintent\"\n\n9\n\ntotally different from the conquest of State power, and another\n\n\u2014an _other_\u2014relation with women). In short, whenever the irruption of war\n\npower is confused with the line of State domination, everything gets mud-\n\ndled; the war machine can then be understood only through the categories\n\nof the negative, since nothing is left that remains outside the State. But,\n\nreturned to its milieu of exteriority, the war machine is seen to be of\n\nanother species, of another nature, of another origin.

This explains the mistrust States have\n\ntoward their military institutions, in that the military institution inherits\n\nan extrinsic war machine. Karl von Clausewitz has a general sense of this\n\nsituation when he treats the flow of absolute war as an Idea that States par-\n\ntially appropriate according to their political needs, and in relation to\n\nwhich they are more or less good \"conductors.\"\n\nTrapped between the two poles of political sovereignty, the man of war\n\nseems outmoded, condemned, without a future, reduced to his own fury,\n\nwhich he turns against himself. The descendants of Hercules, Achilles,\n\nthen Ajax, have enough strength left to proclaim their independence from\n\nAgamemnon, a man of the old State. But they are powerless when it comes\n\nto Ulysses, a man of the nascent modern State, the first man of the modern\n\nState. And it is Ulysses who inherits Achilles' arms, only to convert them to\n\nother uses, submitting them to the laws of the State\u2014not Ajax, who is con-\n\ndemned by the goddess he defied and against whom he sinned.\n\n10\n\nNo one\n\nhas portrayed the situation of the man of war, at once eccentric and con-\n\ndemned, better than Kleist. In _Penthesilea, _Achilles is already separated\n\nfrom his power: the war machine has passed over to the Amazons, a State-\n\nless woman-people whose justice, religion, and loves are organized\n\nuniquely in a war mode. Descendants of the Scythians, the Amazons spring\n\nforth like lightning, \"between\" the two States, the Greek and the Trojan.\n\nThey sweep away everything in their path. Achilles is brought before his\n\ndouble, Penthesilea. And in his ambiguous struggle, Achilles is unable to\n\nprevent himself from marrying the war machine, or from loving Penthe-\n\nsilea, and thus from betraying Agamemnon and Ulysses at the same time.\n\nNevertheless, he already belongs enough to the Greek State that Pen-\n\nthesilea, for her part, cannot enter the passional relation of war with him\n\nwithout herself betraying the collective law of her people, the law of the\n\npack that prohibits \"choosing\" the enemy and entering into one-to-one\n\nrelationships or binary distinctions.\n\nThroughout his work, Kleist celebrates the war machine, setting it\n\nagainst the State apparatus in a struggle that is lost from the start. Doubt-\n\nless Arminius heralds a Germanic war machine that breaks with the imper-\n\nial order of alliances and armies, and stands forever opposed to the Roman\n\nState. But the Prince of Homburg lives only in a dream and stands con-\n\ndemned for having reached victory in disobedience of the law of the State.\n\nAs for Kohlhaas, his war machine can no longer be anything more than\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)378.png)\n\n0\n\n356 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nbanditry. Is it the destiny of the war machine, when the State triumphs, to\n\nbe caught in this alternative: either to be nothing more than the disci-\n\nplined, military organ of the State apparatus, _or to turn against itself, _to\n\nbecome a double suicide machine for a solitary man and a solitary woman?\n\nGoethe and Hegel, State thinkers both, see Kleist as a monster, and Kleist\n\nhas lost from the start. Why is it, then, that the most uncanny modernity\n\nlies with him? It is because the elements of his work are secrecy, speed, and\n\naffect.'' And in Kleist the secret is no longer a content held within a form\nof\n\ninteriority; rather, it becomes a form, identified with the form of\n\nexteriority that is always external to itself. Similarly, feelings become\n\nuprooted from the interiority of a \"subject,\" to be projected violently out-\n\nward into a milieu of pure exteriority that lends them an incredible veloc-\n\nity, a catapulting force: love or hate, they are no longer feelings but\naffects.\n\nAnd these affects are so many instances of the becoming-woman, the\n\nbecoming-animal of the warrior (the bear, she-dogs). Affects transpierce\n\nthe body like arrows, they are weapons of war. The deterritorialization\n\nvelocity of affect. Even dreams (Homburg's, Pentheselea's) are externa-\n\nlized, by a system of relays and plug-ins, extrinsic linkages belonging to the\n\nwar machine. Broken rings. This element of exteriority\u2014which dominates\n\neverything, which Kleist invents in literature, which he is the first to\n\ninvent\u2014will give time a new rhythm: an endless succession of catatonic\n\nepisodes or fainting spells, and flashes or rushes. Catatonia is: \"This affect\n\nis too strong for me,\" and a flash is: \"The power of this affect sweeps me\n\naway,\" so that the Self _(Moi) _is now nothing more than a character whose\n\nactions and emotions are desubjectified, perhaps even to the point of\n\ndeath. Such is Kleist's personal formula: a succession of flights of madness\n\nand catatonic freezes in which no subjective interiority remains. There is\n\nmuch of the East in Kleist: the Japanese fighter, interminably still, who\n\nthen makes a move too quick to see. The Go player. Many things in modern\n\nart come from Kleist. Goethe and Hegel are old men next to Kleist. Could it\n\nbe that it is at the moment the war machine ceases to exist, conquered by\n\nthe State, that it displays to the utmost its irreducibility, that it scatters\ninto\n\nthinking, loving, dying, or creating machines that have at their disposal\n\nvital or revolutionary powers capable of challenging the conquering State?\n\nIs the war machine already overtaken, condemned, appropriated as part of\n\nthe same process whereby it takes on new forms, undergoes a metamorpho-\n\nsis, affirms its irreducibility and exteriority, and deploys that milieu of\n\npure exteriority that the occidental man of the State, or the occidental\n\nthinker, continually reduces to something other than itself?\n\nP\n\nROBLEM\n\nI. _Is there a way of warding off the formation of a State apparatus _\n\n_(or its equivalents in a group)?_\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)379.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 357\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nII. _The exteriority of the war machine is also attested to by _\n\n_ethnology (a tribute to the memory of Pierre Clastres)._\n\nPrimitive, segmentary societies have often been defined as societies\n\nwithout a State, in other words, societies in which distinct organs of power  \ndo not appear. But the conclusion has been that these societies did not  \nreach the degree of economic development, or the level of political differ-  \nentiation, that would make the formation of the State apparatus both  \npossible and inevitable: the implication is that primitive people \"don't  \nunderstand\" so complex an apparatus. The prime interest in Pierre  \nClastres's theories is that they break with this evolutionist postulate. Not  \nonly does he doubt that the State is the product of an ascribable economic  \ndevelopment, but he asks if it is not a potential concern of primitive socie-  \nties to ward off or avert that monster they supposedly do not understand.  \nWarding off the formation of a State apparatus, making such a formation  \nimpossible, would be the objective of a certain number of primitive social  \nmechanisms, even if they are not consciously understood as such. To be  \nsure, primitive societies have _chiefs. _But the State is not defined by the\nexis-  \ntence of chiefs; it is defined by the perpetuation or conservation of organs  \nof power. The concern of the State is to conserve. Special institutions are  \nthus necessary to enable a chief to become a man of State, but diffuse, col-  \nlective mechanisms are just as necessary to prevent a chief from becoming  \none. Mechanisms for warding off, preventive mechanisms, are a part of  \nchieftainship and keep an apparatus distinct from the social body from  \ncrystallizing. Clastres describes the situation of the chief, who has no\ninsti-  \ntuted weapon other than his prestige, no other means of persuasion, no  \nother rule than his sense of the group's desires. The chief is more like a  \nleader or a star than a man of power and is always in danger of being disa-  \nvowed, abandoned by his people. But Clastres goes further, identifying _war  \n_in primitive societies as the surest mechanism directed against the forma-  \ntion of the State: war maintains the dispersal and segmentarity of groups,  \nand the warrior himself is caught in a process of accumulating exploits  \nleading him to solitude and a prestigious but powerless death.\n\n12\n\nClastres\n\ncan thus invoke natural Law while reversing its principal proposition: just  \nas Hobbes saw clearly that _the State was against war, so war is against the  \nState, _and makes it impossible. It should not be concluded that war is a  \nstate of nature, but rather that it is the mode of a social state that wards\noff  \nand prevents the State. Primitive war does not produce the State any more  \nthan it derives from it. And it is no better explained by exchange than by  \nthe State: far from deriving from exchange, even as a sanction for its fail-  \nure, war is what limits exchanges, maintains them in the framework of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)380.png)\n\n0\n\n358 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\n\"alliances\"; it is what prevents them from becoming a State factor, from\n\nfusing groups.\n\nThe importance of this thesis is first of all to draw attention to collective\n\nmechanisms of inhibition. These mechanisms may be subtle, and function\n\nas micromechanisms. This is easily seen in certain band or pack phenom-\n\nena. For example, in the case of gangs of street children in Bogota, Jacques\n\nMeunier cites three ways in which the leader is prevented from acquiring\n\nstable power: the members of the band meet and undertake their theft\n\nactivity in common, with collective sharing of the loot, but they disperse to\n\neat or sleep separately; also, and especially, each member of the band is\n\npaired off with one, two, or three other members, so if he has a disagree-\n\nment with the leader, he will not leave alone but will take along his allies,\n\nwhose combined departure will threaten to break up the entire gang;\n\nfinally, there is a diffuse age limit, and at about age fifteen a member is\n\ninevitably induced to quit the gang.\n\n_1_3\n\nThese mechanisms cannot be under-\n\nstood without renouncing the evolutionist vision that sees bands or packs\n\nas a rudimentary, less organized, social form. Even in bands of animals,\n\nleadership is a complex mechanism that does not act to promote the\n\nstrongest but rather inhibits the installation of stable powers, in favor of a\n\nfabric of immanent relations.\n\n14\n\nOne could just as easily compare the form\n\n\"high-society life\" to the form \"sociability\" among the most highly evolved\n\nmen and women: high-society groups are similar to gangs and operate by\n\nthe diffusion of prestige rather than by reference to centers of power, as in\n\nsocial groupings (Proust clearly showed this noncorrespondence of\n\nhigh-society values and social values). Eugene Sue, a man of high society\n\nand a dandy, whom legitimists reproached for frequenting the Orleans\n\nfamily, used to say: \"I'm not on the side of the family, I side with the\npack.\"\n\nPacks, bands, are groups of the rhizome type, as opposed to the\n\narborescent type that centers around organs of power. That is why bands\n\nin general, even those engaged in banditry or high-society life, are\n\nmetamorphoses of a war machine formally distinct from all State\n\napparatuses or their equivalents, which are instead what structure\n\ncentralized societies. We certainly would not say that discipline is what\n\ndefines a war machine: discipline is the characteristic required of armies\n\nafter the State has appropriated them. The war machine answers to other\n\nrules. We are not saying that they are better, of course, only that they\n\nanimate a fundamental indiscipline of the warrior, a questioning of\n\nhierarchy, perpetual blackmail by abandonment or betrayal, and a very\n\nvolatile sense of honor, all of which, once again, impedes the formation\n\nof the State.\n\nBut why does this argument fail to convince us entirely? We follow\n\nClastres when he demonstrates that the State is explained neither by a\n\ndevelopment of productive forces nor by a differentiation of political\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)381.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 359\n\nforces. It is the State, on the contrary, that makes possible the undertaking\n\nof large-scale projects, the constitution of surpluses, and the organization\n\nof the corresponding public functions. The State is what makes the distinc-\n\ntion between governors and governed possible. We do not see how the State\n\ncan be explained by what it presupposes, even with recourse to dialectics.\n\nThe State seems to rise up in a single stroke, in an imperial form, and does\n\nnot depend on progressive factors. Its on-the-spot emergence is like a\n\nstroke of genius, the birth of Athena. We also follow Clastres when he shows\n\nthat the war machine is directed against the State, either against potential\n\nStates whose formation it wards off in advance, or against actual States\n\nwhose destruction it purposes. No doubt the war machine is realized more\n\ncompletely in the \"barbaric\" assemblages of nomadic warriors than in the\n\n\"savage\" assemblages of primitive societies. In any case, it is out of the\n\nquestion that the State could be the result of a war in which the conquerors\n\nimposed, by the very fact of their victory, a new law on the vanquished,\n\nbecause the organization of the war machine is directed against the\n\nState-form, actual or virtual. The State is no better accounted for as a\n\nresult of war than by a progression of economic or political forces. This\n\nis where Clastres locates the break: between \"primitive\" counter-State\n\nsocieties and \"monstrous\" State societies whose formation it is no longer\n\npossible to explain. Clastres is fascinated by the problem of \"voluntary\n\nservitude,\" in the manner of La Boetie: In what way did people want or\n\ndesire servitude, which most certainly did not come to them as the\n\noutcome of an involuntary and unfortunate war? They did, after all, have\n\ncounter-State mechanisms at their disposal: So how and why the State?\n\nWhy did the State triumph? The more deeply Clastres delved into the\n\nproblem, the more he seemed to deprive himself of the means of resolving\n\nit.'\n\n5\n\nHe tended to make primitive societies hypostases, self-sufficient\n\nentities (he insisted heavily on this point). He made their formal\n\nexteriority into a real independence. Thus he remained an evolutionist,\n\nand posited a state of nature. Only this state of nature was, according to\n\nhim, a fully social reality instead of a pure concept, and the evolution was\n\na sudden mutation instead of a development. For on the one hand, the\n\nState rises up in a single stroke, fully formed; on the other, the\n\ncounter-State societies use very specific mechanisms to ward it off, to\n\nprevent it from arising. We believe that these two propositions are valid\n\nbut that their interlinkage is flawed. There is an old scenario: \"from clans\n\nto empires,\" or \"from bands to kingdoms.\" But nothing says that this\n\nconstitutes an evolution, since bands and clans are no less organized than\n\nempire-kingdoms. We will never leave the evolution hypothesis behind\n\nby creating a break between the two terms, that is, by endowing bands\n\nwith self-sufficiency and the State with an emergence all the more\n\nmiraculous and monstrous.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)382.png)\n\n0\n\n360 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nWe are compelled to say that there has always been a State, quite perfect,\n\nquite complete. The more discoveries archaeologists make, the more\n\nempires they uncover. The hypothesis of the _Urstaat _seems to be verified:\n\n\"The State clearly dates back to the most remote ages of humanity.\" It is\n\nhard to imagine primitive societies that would not have been in contact\n\nwith imperial States, at the periphery or in poorly controlled areas. But of\n\ngreater importance is the inverse hypothesis: that the State itself has always\n\nbeen in a relation with an outside and is inconceivable independent of that\n\nrelationship. The law of the State is not the law of All or Nothing (State\n\nsocieties _or _counter-State societies) but that of interior and exterior. The\n\nState is sovereignty. But sovereignty only reigns over what it is capable of\n\ninternalizing, of appropriating locally. Not only is there no universal State,\n\nbut the outside of States cannot be reduced to \"foreign policy,\" that is, to a\n\nset of relations among States. The outside appears simultaneously in two\n\ndirections: huge worldwide machines branched out over the entire  \n_ecumenon _at a given moment, which enjoy a large measure of autonomy in\n\nrelation to the States (for example, commercial organization of the \"multi-\n\nnational\" type, or industrial complexes, or even religious formations like\n\nChristianity, Islam, certain prophetic or messianic movements, etc.); but\n\nalso the local mechanisms of bands, margins, minorities, which continue\n\nto affirm the rights of segmentary societies in opposition to the organs of\n\nState power. The modern world can provide us today with particularly\n\nwell developed images of these two directions: worldwide ecumenical\n\nmachines, but also a neoprimitivism, a new tribal society as described by\n\nMarshall McLuhan. These directions are equally present in all social\n\nfields, in all periods. It even happens that they partially merge. For exam-\n\nple, a commercial organization is also a band of pillage, or piracy, for part\n\nof its course and in many of its activities; or it is in bands that a\nreligious\n\nformation begins to operate. What becomes clear is that bands, no less than\n\nworldwide organizations, imply a form irreducible to the State and that\n\nthis form of exteriority necessarily presents itself as a diffuse and\n\npolymorphous war machine.

What we are\n\nreferring to are not \"technologies\" in the usual sense of the term. But nei-\n\nther are they \"sciences\" in the royal or legal sense established by history.\n\nAccording to a recent book by Michel Serres, both the atomic physics of\n\nDemocritus and Lucretius and the geometry of Archimedes are marked\n\nby it.\n\n16\n\nThe characteristics of this kind of eccentric science would seem to\n\nbe the following:\n\n1. First of all, it uses a hydraulic model, rather than being a theory of\n\nsolids treating fluids as a special case; ancient atomism is inseparable from\n\nflows, and flux is reality itself, or consistency.\n\n2. The model in question is one of becoming and heterogeneity, as\n\nopposed to the stable, the eternal, the identical, the constant. It is a\n\"para-\n\ndox\" to make becoming itself a model, and no longer a secondary charac-\n\nteristic, a copy; in the _Timaeus, _Plato raises this possibility, but only in\n\norder to exclude it and conjure it away in the name of royal science. By con-\n\ntrast, in atomism, just such a model of heterogeneity, and of passage or\n\nbecoming in the heterogeneous, is furnished by the famed declination of\n\nthe atom. The _clinamen, _as the minimum angle, has meaning only between\n\na straight line and a curve, the curve and its tangent, and constitutes the\n\noriginal curvature of the movement of the atom. The clinamen is the small-\n\nest angle by which an atom deviates from a straight path.\n\n17\n\nIt is a passage to\n\nthe limit, an exhaustion, a paradoxical \"exhaustive\" model. The same\n\napplies to Archimedean geometry, in which the straight line, defined as\n\n\"the shortest path between two points,\" is just a way of defining the length\n\nof a curve in a predifferential calculus.\n\n3. One no longer goes from the straight line to its parallels, in a lamellar\n\nor laminar flow,\n\n18\n\nbut from a curvilinear declination to the formation of\n\nspirals and vortices on an inclined plane: the greatest slope for the smallest\n\nangle. From _turba _to _turbo: _in other words, from bands or packs of atoms\nto\n\nthe great vortical organizations.\n\n19\n\nThe model is a vortical one; it operates in\n\nan open space throughout which things-flows are distributed, rather than\n\nplotting out a closed space for linear and solid things. It is the difference\n\nbetween a _smooth _(vectorial, projective, or topological) space and a\n_striated_\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)384.png)\n\n362 \u25a1 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\n(metric) space: in the first case \"space is occupied without being counted,\"\n\nand in the second case \"space is counted in order to be occupied.\"\n\n20\n\n4\\. Finally, the model is problematic, rather than theorematic: figures\n\nare considered only from the viewpoint of the _affections _that befall them:\n\nsections, ablations, adjunctions, projections. One does not go by specific\n\ndifferences from a genus to its species, or by deduction from a stable\n\nessence to the properties deriving from it, but rather from a problem to\n\nthe accidents that condition and resolve it. This involves all kinds of\n\ndeformations, transmutations, passages to the limit, operations in which\n\neach figure designates an \"event\" much more than an essence; the square\n\nno longer exists independently of a quadrature, the cube of a cubature, the\n\nstraight line of a rectification. Whereas the theorem belongs to the\n\nrational order, the problem is affective and is inseparable from the meta-\n\nmorphoses, generations, and creations within science itself. Despite what\n\nGabriel Marcel may say, the problem is not an \"obstacle\"; it is the surpass-\n\ning of the obstacle, a pro-jection, in other words, a war machine. All of this\n\nmovement is what royal science is striving to limit when it reduces as\n\nmuch as possible the range of the \"problem-element\" and subordinates it\n\nto the \"theorem-element.\"\n\n21\n\nThis Archimedean science, or this conception of science, is bound up in\n\nan essential way with the war machine: the_problemata _are the war machine\n\nitself and are inseparable from inclined planes, passages to the limit, vorti-\n\nces, and projections. It would seem that the war machine is projected into\n\nan abstract knowledge formally different from the one that doubles the\n\nState apparatus. It would seem that a whole nomad science develops\n\neccentrically, one that is very different from the royal or imperial sciences.\n\nFurthermore, this nomad science is continually \"barred,\" inhibited, or\n\nbanned by the demands and conditions of State science. Archimedes, van-\n\nquished by the Roman State, becomes a symbol.\n\n22\n\nThe fact is that the two\n\nkinds of science have different modes of formalization, and State science\n\ncontinually imposes its form of sovereignty on the inventions of nomad\n\nscience. State science retains of nomad science only what it can appropri-\n\nate; it turns the rest into a set of strictly limited formulas without any\nreal\n\nscientific status, or else simply represses and bans it. It is as if the\n\"savants\"\n\nof nomad science were caught between a rock and a hard place, between the\n\nwar machine that nourishes and inspires them and the State that imposes\n\nupon them an order of reasons. The figure of the _engineer _(in particular the\n\nmilitary engineer), with all its ambivalence, is illustrative of this\nsituation.\n\nMost significant are perhaps borderline phenomena in which nomad sci-\n\nence exerts pressure on State science, and, conversely, State science appro-\n\npriates and transforms the elements of nomad science.

It is true of\n\ndescriptive and projective geometry, which royal science would like to turn\n\ninto a mere practical dependency of analytic, or so-called higher, geometry\n\n(thus the ambiguous situation of Monge and Poncelet as \"savants\").\n\n23\n\nIt is\n\nalso true of differential calculus. For a long time, it had only\nparascientific\n\nstatus and was labeled a \"Gothic hypothesis\"; royal science only accorded\n\nit the value of a convenient convention or a well-founded fiction. The great\n\nState mathematicians did their best to improve its status, but precisely on\n\nthe condition that all the dynamic, nomadic notions\u2014such as becoming,\n\nheterogeneity, infinitesimal, passage to the limit, continuous variation\n\n\u2014be eliminated and civil, static, and ordinal rules be imposed upon it\n\n(Carnot's ambiguous position in this respect). Finally, it is true of the\n\nhydraulic model, for it is certain that the State itself needs a hydraulic\nsci-\n\nence (there is no going back on Wittfogel's theses on the importance of\n\nlarge-scale waterworks for an empire). But it needs it in a very different\n\nform, because the State needs to subordinate hydraulic force to conduits,\n\npipes, embankments, which prevent turbulence, which constrain move-\n\nment to go from one point to another, and space itself to be striated and\n\nmeasured, which makes the fluid depend on the solid, and flows proceed\n\nby parallel, laminar layers. The hydraulic model of nomad science and the\n\nwar machine, on the other hand, consists in being distributed by turbu-\n\nlence across a smooth space, in producing a movement that holds space\n\nand simultaneously affects all of its points, instead of being held by space\nin\n\na local movement from one specified point to another.\n\n24\n\nDemocritus,\n\nMenaechmus, Archimedes, Vauban, Desargues, Bernoulli, Monge,\n\nCarnot, Poncelet, Perronet, etc.: in each case a monograph would be neces-\n\nsary to take into account the special situation of these savants whom State\n\nscience used only after restraining or disciplining them, after repressing\n\ntheir social or political conceptions.\n\nThe sea as a smooth space is a specific problem of the war machine. As\n\nVirilio shows, it is at sea that the problem of the _fleet in being _is posed,\nin\n\nother words, the task of occupying an open space with a vortical movement\n\nthat can rise up at any point. In this respect, the recent studies on rhythm,\n\non the origin of that notion, do not seem entirely convincing. For we are\n\ntold that rhythm has nothing to do with the movement of waves but rather\n\nthat it designates \"form\" in general, and more specifically the form of a\n\n\"measured, cadenced\" movement.\n\n25\n\nHowever, rhythm is never the same as\n\nmeasure.

The work of Anne Querrien\n\nenables us to identify two of these moments; one is the construction of\n\nGothic cathedrals in the twelfth century, the other the construction of\n\nbridges in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\n26\n\nGothic architecture is\n\nindeed inseparable from a will to build churches longer and taller than the\n\nRomanesque churches. Ever farther, ever higher ... But this difference is\n\nnot simply quantitative; it marks a qualitative change: the static relation,\n\nform-matter, tends to fade into the background in favor of a dynamic rela-\n\ntion, material-forces. It is the cutting of the stone that turns it into\nmaterial\n\ncapable of holding and coordinating forces of thrust, and of constructing\n\never higher and longer vaults. The vault is no longer a form but the line of\n\ncontinuous variation of the stones. It is as if Gothic conquered a smooth\n\nspace, while Romanesque remained partially within a striated space (in\n\nwhich the vault depends on the juxtaposition of parallel pillars). But stone\n\ncutting is inseparable from, on the one hand, a plane of projection at\n\nground level, which functions as a plane limit, and, on the other hand, a\n\nseries of successive approximations (squaring), or placings-in-variation of\n\nvoluminous stones. Of course, one appealed to the theorematic science of\n\nEuclid in order to find a foundation for the enterprise: mathematical fig-\n\nures and equations were thought to be the intelligible form capable of orga-\n\nnizing surfaces and volumes. But according to the legend, Bernard de\n\nClairvaux quickly abandoned the effort as too \"difficult,\" appealing to the\n\nspecificity of an operative, Archimedean geometry, a projective and\n\ndescriptive geometry defined as a minor science, more a mathegraphy than\n\na matheology. His journeyman, the monk-mason Garin de Troyes, speaks\n\nof an operative logic of movement enabling the \"initiate\" to draw, then hew\n\nthe volumes \"in penetration in space,\" to make it so that \"the cutting line\n\npropels the equation\" _(le trait pousse le chiffre)._\n\n_21_\n\n_ _One does not represent,\n\none engenders and traverses.

This whole current of Archimedean geometry was taken to its\n\nhighest expression, but was also brought to a temporary standstill, by the\n\nremarkable seventeenth-century mathematician Desargues. Like most of\n\nhis kind, Desargues wrote little; he nevertheless exerted a great influence\n\nthrough his actions and left outlines, rough drafts, and projects, all cen-\n\ntered on problem-events: \"Lamentations,\" \"draft project for the cutting of\n\nstones,\" \"draft project for grappling with the events of the encounters of a\n\ncone and a plane,. .. Desargues, however, was condemned by the  \n_parlement _of Paris, opposed by the king's secretary; his practices of per-\n\nspective were banned.\n\n28\n\nRoyal, or State, science only tolerates and appro-\n\npriates stone cutting by means of _templates _(the opposite of squaring),\n\nunder conditions that restore the primacy of the fixed model of form,\n\nmathematical figures, and measurement. Royal science only tolerates and\n\nappropriates perspective if it is static, subjected to a central black hole\n\ndivesting it of its heuristic and ambulatory capacities. But the adventure,\n\nor event, of Desargues is the same one that had already occurred among the\n\nGothic \"journeymen\" on a collective level. For not only did the Church, in\n\nits imperial form, feel the need to strictly control the movement of this\n\nnomad science (it entrusted the Templars with the responsibility of deter-\n\nmining its locations and objects, governing the work sites, and regulating\n\nconstruction), but the secular State, in its royal form, turned against the\n\nTemplars themselves, banning the guilds for a number of reasons, at least\n\none of which was the prohibition of this operative or minor geometry.\n\nIs Anne Querrien right to find yet another echo of the same story in the\n\ncase of bridges in the eighteenth century? Doubtless, the conditions were\n\nvery different, for the division of labor according to State norms was by\n\nthen an accomplished fact. But the fact remains that in the government\n\nagency in charge of bridges and roadways, roadways were under a\n\nwell-centralized administration while bridges were still the object of\n\nactive, dynamic, and collective experimentation. Trudaine organized\n\nunusual, open \"general assemblies\" in his home. Perronet took as his\n\ninspiration a supple model originating in the Orient: The bridge should\n\nnot choke or obstruct the river. To the heaviness of the bridge, to the\n\nstriated space of thick and regular piles, he opposed a thinning and\n\ndiscontinuity of the piles, surbase, and vault, a lightness and continuous\n\nvariation of the whole. But his attempt soon ran up against principled\n\nopposition; the State, in naming Perronet director of the school, followed\n\na frequently used procedure that inhibited experimentation more than\n\ncrowning its achievements. The whole history of the Ecole des Ponts et\n\nChaussees (School of Bridges and Roadways) illustrates how this old,\n\nplebeian \"corps\" was subordinated to the Ecole des Mines, the Ecole des\n\nTravaux Publics, and the Ecole Polytechnique, at the same time as its\n\nactivities were increasingly\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)388.png)\n\n0\n\n366 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nnormalized.\n\n29\n\nWe thus come to the question, What is a collective _bodyl _\n\nUndoubtedly, the great collective bodies of a State are differentiated and\n\nhierarchical organisms that on the one hand enjoy a monopoly over a\n\npower or function and on the other hand send out local representatives.\n\nThey have a special relation to families, because they link the family model\n\nto the State model at both ends and regard themselves as \"great families\" of\n\nfunctionaries, clerks, intendants, or farmers. Yet it seems that in many of\n\nthese collective bodies there is something else at work that does not fit into\n\nthis schema. It is not just their obstinate defense of their privileges. It is\nalso\n\ntheir aptitude\u2014even caricatural or seriously deformed\u2014to constitute\n\nthemselves as a war machine, following other models, another dynamism,\n\na nomadic ambition, over against the State. As an example, there is the\n\nvery old problem of the _lobby, _a group with fluid contours, whose position\n\nis very ambiguous in relation to the State it wishes to \"influence\" and the\n\nwar machine it wishes to promote, to whatever ends.\n\n30\n\nA _body {corps) _is not reducible to an _organism, _any more than esprit de\n\ncorps is reducible to the soul of an organism. Spirit is not better, but it is\n\nvolatile, whereas the soul is weighted, a center of gravity. Must we invoke a\n\nmilitary origin of the collective body and esprit de corps? \"Military\" is not\n\nthe part that counts, but rather the distant nomadic origin. Ibn Khaldun\n\ndefines the nomad war machine by: families or lineages\n\nPLUS\n\nesprit de\n\ncorps. The war machine entertains a relation to families that is very differ-\n\nent from its relation to the State. In the war machine, the family is a band\n\nvector instead of a fundamental cell; a genealogy is transferred from one\n\nfamily to another according to the aptitude of a given family at a given time\n\nto realize the maximum of \"agnatic solidarity.\" Here, it is not the public\n\neminence of a family that determines its place in a State organism but the\n\nreverse; it is the secret power _(puissance), _or strength of solidarity, and\nthe\n\ncorresponding genealogical mobility that determine its eminence in a war\n\nbody.\n\n31\n\nThis has to do neither with the monopoly of an organic power\n\n_(pouvoir) _nor with local representation, but is related to the potential\n_(puis-  \nsance) _of a vortical body in a nomad space. Of course, the great bodies of a\n\nmodern State can hardly be thought of as Arab tribes. What we wish to say,\n\nrather, is that collective bodies always have fringes or minorities that\nrecon-\n\nstitute equivalents of the war machine\u2014in sometimes quite unforeseen\n\nforms\u2014in specific assemblages such as building bridges or cathedrals or\n\nrendering judgments or making music or instituting a science, a technology\n\n... A collective body of captains asserts its demands through the organiza-\n\ntion of the officers and the organism of the superior officers.

These essences are distinct\n\nfrom sensible things, as well as from ideal, royal, or imperial essences.\n\nProtogeometry, the science dealing with them, is itself vague, in the etymo-\n\nlogical sense of \"vagabond\": it is neither inexact like sensible things nor\n\nexact like ideal essences, but _anexactyet rigorous _(\"essentially and not\nacci-\n\ndentally inexact\"). The circle is an organic, ideal, fixed essence, but round-\n\nness is a vague and fluent essence, distinct both from the circle and things\n\nthat are round (a vase, a wheel, the sun). A theorematic figure is a fixed\n\nessence, but its transformations, distortions, ablations, and augmentations,\n\nall of its variations, form problematic figures that are vague yet rigorous,\n\n\"lens-shaped,\" \"umbelliform,\" or \"indented.\" It could be said that vague\n\nessences extract from things a determination that is more than thinghood  \n_(choseite), _which is that _of corporeality (corporeite), _and which perhaps\n\neven implies an esprit de corps.\n\n32\n\nBut why does Husserl see this as a\n\nprotogeometry, a kind of halfway point and not a pure science? Why does\n\nhe make pure essences dependent upon a passage to the limit, when any\n\npassage to the limit belongs as such to the vague? What we have, rather, are\n\ntwo formally different conceptions of science, and, ontologically, a single\n\nfield of interaction in which royal science continually appropriates the\n\ncontents of vague or nomad science while nomad science continually cuts\n\nthe contents of royal science loose. At the limit, all that counts is the con-\n\nstantly shifting borderline. In Husserl (and also in Kant, though in the\n\nopposite direction: roundness as the \"schema\" of the circle), we find a very\n\naccurate appreciation of the irreducibility of nomad science, but simulta-\n\nneously the concern of a man of the State, or one who sides with the State,\n\nto maintain a legislative and constituent primacy for royal science. When-\n\never this primacy is taken for granted, nomad science is portrayed as a\n\nprescientific or parascientific or subscientific agency. And most impor-\n\ntant, it becomes impossible to understand the relations between science\n\nand technology, science and practice, because nomad science is not a sim-\n\nple technology or practice, but a scientific field in which the problem of\n\nthese relations is brought out and resolved in an entirely different way than\n\nfrom the point of view of royal science.

We know of the problems States have always had with journey-\n\nmen's associations, or _compagnonnages, _the nomadic or itinerant bodies\n\nof the type formed by masons, carpenters, smiths, etc. Settling,\n\nseden-tarizing labor power, regulating the movement of the flow of labor,\n\nassigning it channels and conduits, forming corporations in the sense of\n\norganisms, and, for the rest, relying on forced manpower recruited on the\n\nspot (corvee) or among indigents (charity workshops)\u2014this has always\n\nbeen one of the principal affairs of the State, which undertook to conquer\n\nboth a _band vagabondage _and a _body nomadism. _Let us return to the exam-\n\nple of Gothic architecture for a reminder of how extensively the journey-\n\nmen traveled, building cathedrals near and far, scattering construction\n\nsites across the land, drawing on an active and passive power (mobility and\n\nthe strike) that was far from convenient for the State. The State's response\n\nwas to take over management of the construction sites, merging all the divi-\n\nsions of labor in the supreme distinction between the intellectual and the\n\nmanual, the theoretical and the practical, modeled upon the difference\n\nbetween \"governors\" and \"governed.\" In the nomad sciences, as in the\n\nroyal sciences, we find the existence of a \"plane,\" but not at all in the same\n\nway. The ground-level plane of the Gothic journeyman is opposed to the\n\nmetric plane of the architect, which is on paper and off site. The plane of\n\nconsistency or composition is opposed to another plane, that of organiza-\n\ntion or formation. Stone cutting by squaring is opposed to stone cutting\n\nusing templates, which implies the erection of a model for reproduction. It\n\ncan be said not only that there is no longer a need for skilled or qualified\n\nlabor, but also that there is a need for unskilled or unqualified labor, for a\n\ndequalification of labor. The State does not give power _(pouvoir) _to the\n\nintellectuals or conceptual innovators; on the contrary, it makes them a\n\nstrictly dependent organ with an autonomy that is only imagined yet is suf-\n\nficient to divest those whose job it becomes simply to reproduce or imple-\n\nment of all of their power _(puissance). _This does not shield the State from\n\nmore trouble, this time with the body of intellectuals it itself engendered,\n\nbut which asserts new nomadic and political claims. In any case, if the State\n\nalways finds it necessary to repress the nomad and minor sciences, if it\n\nopposes vague essences and the operative geometry of the trait, it does so\n\nnot because the content of these sciences is inexact or imperfect, or because\n\nof their magic or initiatory character, but because they imply a division of\n\nlabor opposed to the norms of the State.

Royal science is inseparable from a\n\n\"hylomorphic\" model implying both a form that organizes matter and a\n\nmatter prepared for the form; it has often been shown that this schema\n\nderives less from technology or life than from a society divided into gover-\n\nnors and governed, and later, intellectuals and manual laborers. What\n\ncharacterizes it is that all matter is assigned to content, while all form\n\npasses into expression. It seems that nomad science is more immediately in\n\ntune with the connection between content and expression in themselves,\n\neach of these two terms encompassing both form and matter. Thus matter,\n\nin nomad science, is never prepared and therefore homogenized matter,\n\nbut is essentially laden with singularities (which constitute a form of con-\n\ntent). And neither is expression formal; it is inseparable from pertinent\n\ntraits (which constitute a matter of expression). This is an entirely\ndifferent\n\nschema, as we shall see. We can get a preliminary idea of this situation by\n\nrecalling the most general characteristic of nomad art, in which a dynamic\n\nconnection between support and ornament replaces the matter-form dia-\n\nlectic. From the point of view of nomad science, which presents itself as an\n\nart as much as a technique, the division of labor fully exists, but it does\nnot\n\nemploy the form-matter duality (even in the case of biunivocal corre-\n\nspondences). Rather, it _follows _the connections between singularities of\n\nmatter and traits of expression, and lodges on the level of these connec-\n\ntions, whether they be natural or forced.\n\n33\n\nThis is another organization of\n\nwork and of the social field through work.\n\nIt is instructive to contrast two models of science, after the manner of\n\nPlato in the _Timaeus._\n\n_34_\n\n_ _One could be called _Compars _and the other\n\n_Dispars. _The compars is the legal or legalist model employed by royal sci-\n\nence. The search for laws consists in extracting constants, even if those con-\n\nstants are only relations between variables (equations). An invariable form\n\nfor variables, a variable matter of the invariant: such is the foundation of\n\nthe hylomorphic schema. But for the dispars as an element of nomad sci-\n\nence the relevant distinction is material-forces rather than matter-form.\n\nHere, it is not exactly a question of extracting constants from variables but\n\nof placing the variables themselves in a state of continuous variation. If\n\nthere are still equations, they are adequations, inequations, differential\n\nequations irreducible to the algebraic form and inseparable from a sensible\n\nintuition of variation. They seize or determine singularities in the matter,\n\ninstead of constituting a general form. They effect individuations through\n\nevents or haecceities, not through the \"object\" as a compound of matter\n\nand form; vague essences are nothing other than haecceities.

That it does is evident in the homogeneous\n\nspace corresponding to the compars. Homogeneous space is in no way a\n\nsmooth space; on the contrary, it is the form of striated space. The space of  \n_pillars. _It is striated by the fall of bodies, the verticals of gravity, the\ndistri-\n\nbution of matter into parallel layers, the lamellar and laminar movement\n\nof flows. These parallel verticals have formed an independent dimension\n\ncapable of spreading everywhere, of formalizing all the other dimensions,\n\nof striating all of space in all of its directions, so as to render it homoge-\n\nneous. The vertical distance between two points provided the mode of\n\ncomparison for the horizontal distance between two other points. Univer-\n\nsal attraction became the law of all laws, in that it set the rule for the\n\nbiunivocal correspondence between two bodies; and each time science dis-\n\ncovered a new field, it sought to formalize it in the same mode as the field\nof\n\ngravity. Even chemistry became a royal science only by virtue of a whole\n\ntheoretical elaboration of the notion of weight. Euclidean space is founded\n\non the famous parallel postulate, but the parallels in question are in the\n\nfirst place gravitational parallels, and correspond to the forces exerted by\n\ngravity on all the elements of a body presumed to fill that space. It is the\n\npoint of application of the resultant of all of these parallel forces that\n\nremains invariable when their common direction is changed or the body is\n\nrotated (the _center of gravity). _In short, it seems that the force of\ngravity lies\n\nat the basis of a laminar, striated, homogeneous, and centered space; it\n\nforms the foundation for those multiplicities termed metric, or\n\narborescent, whose dimensions are independent of the situation and are\n\nexpressed with the aid of units and points (movements from one point to\n\nanother). It was not some metaphysical concern, but an effectively scien-\n\ntific one, that frequently led scientists in the nineteenth century to ask if\nall\n\nforces were not reducible to gravity, or rather to the form of attraction that\n\ngives gravity a universal value (a constant relation for all variables) and\n\nbiunivocal scope (two bodies at a time, and no more). It is the form of\n\ninteriority of all science.\n\nThe _nomos, _or the dispars, is altogether different. But this is not to say\n\nthat the other forces refute gravity or contradict attraction. Although it is\n\ntrue that they do not go against them, they do not result from them either;\n\nthey do not depend on them but testify to events that are always supple-\n\nmentary or of \"variable affects.\" Each time a new _field _opened up in\n\nscience\u2014under conditions making this a far more important notion than\n\nthat of form or object\u2014it proved irreducible to the field of attraction and\n\nthe model of the gravitational forces, although not contradictory to them.\n\nIt affirmed a \"more\" or an excess, and lodged itself in that excess, that\ndevi-\n\nation.

Smooth space is\n\nprecisely the space of the smallest deviation: therefore it has no homogene-\n\nity, except between infinitely proximate points, and the linking of proximi-\n\nties is effected independently of any determined path. It is a space of\n\ncontact, of small tactile or manual actions of contact, rather than a visual\n\nspace like Euclid's striated space. Smooth space is a field without conduits\n\nor channels. A field, a heterogeneous smooth space, is wedded to a very\n\nparticular type of multiplicity: nonmetric, acentered, rhizomatic multipli-\n\ncities that occupy space without \"counting\" it and can \"be explored only by\n\nlegwork.\" They do not meet the visual condition of being observable from a\n\npoint in space external to them; an example of this is the system of sounds,\n\nor even of colors, as opposed to Euclidean space.\n\nWhen we oppose speed and slowness, the quick and the weighty,\n\n_Celeritas and Gravitas, _this must not be seen as a quantitative opposition,\n\nor as a mythological structure (although Dumezil has established the myth-\n\nological importance of this opposition, precisely in relation to the State\n\napparatus and its natural \"gravity\"). The opposition is both qualitative\n\nand scientific, in that speed is not merely an abstract characteristic of\n\nmovement in general but is incarnated in a moving body that deviates,\n\nhowever slightly, from its line of descent or gravity. _Slow and rapid are not  \nquantitative degrees of movement but rather two types of qualified move-  \nment, _whatever the speed of the former or the tardiness of the latter.\n\nStrictly speaking, it cannot be said that a body that is dropped has a speed,\n\nhowever fast it falls; rather it has an infinitely decreasing slowness in\naccor-\n\ndance with the law of falling bodies. Laminar movement that striates\n\nspace, that goes from one point to another, is weighty; but rapidity,\ncelerity,\n\napplies only to movement that deviates to the minimum extent and there-\n\nafter assumes a vortical motion, occupying a smooth space, actually draw-\n\ning smooth space itself. In this space, matter-flow can no longer be cut into\n\nparallel layers, and movement no longer allows itself to be hemmed into\n\nbiunivocal relations between points. In this sense, the role of the qualita-\n\ntive opposition gravity-celerity, heavy-light, slow-rapid is not that of a\n\nquantifiable scientific determination but of a condition that is coextensive\n\nto science and that regulates both the separation and the mixing of the two\n\nmodels, their possible interpenetration, the domination of one by the\n\nother, their alternative.

Itineration is\ntoo\n\nreadily reduced to a modality of technology, or of the application and veri-\n\nfication of science. But this is not the case: _following is not at all the\nsame  \nthing as reproducing, _and one never follows in order to reproduce. The\n\nideal of reproduction, deduction, or induction is part of royal science, at\nall\n\ntimes and in all places, and treats differences of time and place as so many\n\nvariables, the constant form of which is extracted precisely by the law: for\n\nthe same phenomena to recur in a gravitational and striated space it is suf-\n\nficient for the same conditions to obtain, or for the same constant relation\n\nto hold between the differing conditions and the variable phenomena.\n\nReproducing implies the permanence of a fixed point of _view _that is exter-\n\nnal to what is reproduced: watching the flow from the bank. But following\n\nis something different from the ideal of reproduction. Not better, just dif-\n\nferent. One is obliged to follow when one is in search of the \"singularities\"\n\nof a matter, or rather of a material, and not out to discover a form; when\n\none escapes the force of gravity to enter a field of celerity; when one ceases\n\nto contemplate the course of a laminar flow in a determinate direction, to\n\nbe carried away by a vortical flow; when one engages in a continuous varia-\n\ntion of variables, instead of extracting constants from them, etc. And the\n\nmeaning of Earth completely changes: with the legal model, one is con-\n\nstantly reterritorializing around a point of view, on a domain, according to\n\na set of constant relations; but with the ambulant model, the process of\n\ndeterritorialization constitutes and extends the territory itself. \"Go first\nto\n\nyour old plant and watch carefully the watercourse made by the rain.

There is always a current preventing the ambu-\n\nlant or itinerant sciences from being completely internalized in the repro-\n\nductive royal sciences. There is a type of ambulant scientist whom State\n\nscientists are forever fighting or integrating or allying with, even going so\n\nfar as to propose a minor position for them within the legal system of sci-\n\nence and technology.\n\nIt is not that the ambulant sciences are more saturated with irrational\n\nprocedures, with mystery and magic. They only get that way when they fall\n\ninto abeyance. And the royal sciences, for their part, also surround them-\n\nselves with much priestliness and magic. Rather, what becomes apparent\n\nin the rivalry between the two models is that the ambulant or nomad sci-\n\nences do not destine science to take on an autonomous power, or even to\n\nhave an autonomous development.

Certain of these requirements are translated in terms of \"safety\":\n\nthe two cathedrals at Orleans and Beauvais collapsed at the end of the\n\ntwelfth century, and control calculations are difficult to effect for the con-\n\nstructions of ambulant science. Although safety is a fundamental element\n\nin the theoretical norms of the State, and of the political ideal, there is\nalso\n\nsomething else at issue as well. Due to all their procedures, the ambulant\n\nsciences quickly overstep the possibility of calculation: they inhabit that\n\n\"more\" that exceeds the space of reproduction and soon run into problems\n\nthat are insurmountable from that point of view; they eventually resolve\n\nthose problems by means of a real-life operation. The solutions are sup-\n\nposed to come from a set of activities that constitute them as\n\nnonautono-mous. Only royal science, in contrast, has at its disposal a metric\n\npower that can define a conceptual apparatus or an autonomy of science\n\n(including the autonomy of experimental science). That is why it is\n\nnecessary to couple ambulant spaces with a space of homogeneity, without\n\nwhich the laws of physics would depend on particular points in space. But\n\nthis is less a translation than a constitution: precisely that constitution\nthe\n\nambulant sciences did not undertake, and do not have the means to\n\nundertake. In the field of interaction of the two sciences, the ambulant\n\nsciences confine themselves to _inventing problems _whose solution is tied\n\nto a whole set of collective, nonscientific activities but whose _scientific  \nsolution _depends, on the contrary, on royal science and the way it has\n\ntransformed the problem by introducing it into its theorematic apparatus\n\nand its organization of work. This is somewhat like intuition and\n\nintelligence in Bergson, where only intelligence has the scientific means\n\nto solve formally the problems posed by intuition, problems that intuition\n\nwould be content to entrust to the qualitative activities of a humanity\n\nengaged in _following _matter.\n\n40\n\nP\n\nROBLEM\n\nII. _Is there a way to extricate thought from the State model? _\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nIV. _The exteriority of the war machine is attested to, _\n\n_finally, by noology._\n\nThought contents are sometimes criticized for being too conformist.\n\nBut the primary question is that of form itself.

It is not out of the question, however, that in order to pass\n\nfrom one to the other there must occur, \"between\" them, an event of an\n\nentirely different nature, one that hides outside the image, takes place out-\n\nside.\n\n41\n\nBut confining ourselves to the image, it appears that it is not simply a\n\nmetaphor when we are told of an _imperium _of truth and a republic of spirits.\n\nIt is the necessary condition for the constitution of thought as principle, or\n\nas a form of interiority, as a stratum.\n\nIt is easy to see what thought gains from this: a gravity it would never\n\nhave on its own, a center that makes everything, including the State, appear\n\nto exist by its own efficacy or on its own sanction. But the State gains just\nas\n\nmuch. Indeed, by developing in thought in this way the State-form gains\n\nsomething essential: a whole consensus. Only thought is capable of invent-\n\ning the fiction of a State that is universal by right, of elevating the State\nto\n\nthe level of de jure universality. It is as if the sovereign were left alone\nin the\n\nworld, spanned the entire ecumenon, and now dealt only with actual or\n\npotential subjects. It is no longer a question of powerful, extrinsic\norganiza-\n\ntions, or of strange bands: the State becomes the sole principle separating\n\nrebel subjects, who are consigned to the state of nature, from consenting\n\nsubjects, who rally to its form of their own accord. If it is advantageous for\n\nthought to prop itself up with the State, it is no less advantageous for the\n\nState to extend itself in thought, and to be sanctioned by it as the unique,\n\nuniversal form. The particularity of States becomes merely an accident of\n\nfact, as is their possible perversity, or their imperfection. For the modern\n\nState defines itself in principle as \"the rational and reasonable organiza-\n\ntion of a community\": the only remaining particularity a community has is\n\ninterior or moral _(the spirit of a people), _at the same time as the\ncommunity\n\nis funneled by its organization toward the harmony of a universal _(absolute  \nspirit). _The State gives thought a form of interiority, and thought gives\nthat\n\ninteriority a form of universality: \"The goal of worldwide organization is\n\nthe satisfaction of reasonable individuals within particular free States.\"\n\nThe exchange that takes place between the State and reason is a curious\n\none; but that exchange is also an analytic proposition, because realized rea-\n\nson is identified with the de jure State, just as the State is the becoming of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)398.png)\n\n0\n\n376 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nreason.\n\n42\n\nIn so-called modern philosophy, and in the so-called modern or\n\nrational State, everything revolves around the legislator and the subject.\n\nThe State must realize the distinction between the legislator and the sub-\n\nject under formal conditions permitting thought, for its part, to conceptu-\n\nalize their identity.

This was most notably the great operation of the Kantian \"cri-\n\ntique,\" renewed and developed by Hegelianism. Kant was constantly criti-\n\ncizing bad usages, the better to consecrate the function. It is not at all\n\nsurprising that the philosopher has become a public professor or State\n\nfunctionary. It was all over the moment the State-form inspired an image of\n\nthought. With full reciprocity. Doubtless, the image itself assumes differ-\n\nent contours in accordance with the variations on this form: it has not\n\nalways delineated or designated the philosopher, and will not always delin-\n\neate him. It is possible to pass from a magical function to a rational func-\n\ntion. The poet in the archaic imperial State was able to play the role of\n\nimage trainer.\n\n43\n\nIn modern States, the sociologist succeeded in replacing\n\nthe philosopher (as, for example, when Durkheim and his disciples set out\n\nto give the republic a secular model of thought). Even today, psychoanaly-\n\nsis lays claim to the role of _Cogitatio universalis _as the thought of the\nLaw,\n\nin a magical return. And there are quite a few other competitors and pre-\n\ntenders. Noology, which is distinct from ideology, is precisely the study of\n\nimages of thought, and their historicity. In a sense, it could be said that\nall\n\nthis has no importance, that thought has never had anything but laughable\n\ngravity. But that is all it requires: for us not to take it seriously. Because\nthat\n\nmakes it all the easier for it to think for us, and to be forever engendering\n\nnew functionaries. Because the less people take thought seriously, the more\n\nthey think in conformity with what the State wants. Truly, what man of the\n\nState has not dreamed of that paltry impossible thing\u2014to be a thinker?\n\nBut noology is confronted by counterthoughts, which are violent in their\n\nacts and discontinuous in their appearances, and whose existence is mobile\n\nin history. These are the acts of a \"private thinker,\" as opposed to the\npublic\n\nprofessor: Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, or even Shestov. Wherever they dwell,\n\nit is the steppe or the desert. They destroy images. Nietzsche's _Schopen-  \nhauer as Educator _is perhaps the greatest critique ever directed against the\n\nimage of thought and its relation to the State. \"Private thinker,\" however, is\n\nnot a satisfactory expression, because it exaggerates interiority, when it is\na\n\nquestion of _outside thought._\n\n_44_\n\n_ _To place thought in an immediate relation\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)399.png)\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 377\n\nwith the outside, with the forces of the outside, in short to make thought a\n\nwar machine, is a strange undertaking whose precise procedures can be\n\nstudied in Nietzsche (the aphorism, for example, is very different from the\n\nmaxim, for a maxim, in the republic of letters, is like an organic State act\nor\n\nsovereign judgment, whereas an aphorism always awaits its meaning from\n\na new external force, a final force that must conquer or subjugate it, utilize\n\nit).

The other is the text by Kleist, \"On the Gradual\n\nFormation of Ideas in Speech\" (\"Uber die allmachliche Verfertigung der\n\nGedanken beim Reden\"), in which Kleist denounces the central interiority\n\nof the concept as a means of control\u2014the control of speech, of language,\n\nbut also of affects, circumstances and even chance. He distinguishes this\n\nfrom thought as a proceeding and a process, a bizarre anti-Platonic dia-\n\nlogue, an antidialogue between brother and sister where one speaks before\n\nknowing while the other relays before having understood: this, Kleist says,\n\nis the thought of the _Gemut, _which proceeds like a general in a war machine\n\nshould, or like a body charged with electricity, with pure intensity. \"I mix\n\ninarticulate sounds, lengthen transitional terms, as well as using apposi-\n\ntions when they are unnecessary.\" Gain some time, and then perhaps\n\nrenounce, or wait. The necessity of not having control over language, of\n\nbeing a foreigner in one's own tongue, in order to draw speech to oneself\n\nand \"bring something incomprehensible into the world.\" Such is the form\n\nof exteriority, the relation between brother and sister, the\n\nbecoming-woman of the thinker, the becoming-thought of the woman: the  \n_Gemut _that refuses to be controlled, that forms a war machine. A thought\n\ngrappling with exterior forces instead of being gathered up in an interior\n\nform, operating by relays instead of forming an image; an event-thought, a\n\nhaecceity, instead of a subject-thought, a problem-thought instead of an\n\nessence-thought or theorem; a thought that appeals to a people instead of\n\ntaking itself for a government ministry. Is it by chance that whenever a\n\n\"thinker\" shoots an arrow, there is a man of the State, a shadow or an image\n\nof a man of the State, that counsels and admonishes him, and wants to\n\nassign him a target or \"aim\"?

Between the two, all of the varieties of the real\nand\n\nthe true find their place in a striated mental space, from the double point\n\nof view of Being and the Subject, under the direction of a \"universal\n\nmethod.\" It is now easy for us to characterize the nomad thought that\n\nrejects this image and does things differently. It does not ally itself with a\n\nuniversal thinking subject but, on the contrary, with a singular race; and it\n\ndoes not ground itself in an all-encompassing totality but is on the\n\ncontrary deployed in a horizonless milieu that is a smooth space, steppe,\n\ndesert, or sea. An entirely different type of adequation is established here,\n\nbetween the race defined as \"tribe\" and smooth space defined as \"milieu.\"\n\nA tribe in the desert instead of a universal subject within the horizon of\n\nall-encompassing Being. Kenneth White recently stressed this\n\ndissymmetrical complementarity between a race-tribe (the Celts, those\n\nwho feel they are Celts) and a milieu-space (the Orient, the Gobi\n\ndesert...). White demonstrates that this strange composite, the marriage of\n\nthe Celt and the Orient, inspires a properly nomad thought that sweeps up\n\nEnglish literature and constitutes American literature.\n\n47\n\nWe immediately\n\nsee the dangers, the profound ambiguities accompanying in this\n\nenterprise, as if each effort and each creation faced a possible infamy. For\n\nwhat can be done to prevent the theme of a race from turning into a\n\nracism, a dominant and all-encompassing fascism, or into a sect and a\n\nfolklore, microfascisms? And what can be done to prevent the oriental\n\npole from becoming a phantasy that reactivates all the fascisms in a\n\ndifferent way, and also all the folklores, yoga, Zen, and karate? It is\n\ncertainly not enough to travel to escape phantasy, and it is certainly not by\n\ninvoking a past, real or mythical, that one avoids racism. But here again,\n\nthe criteria for making the distinction are simple, whatever the de facto\n\nmixes that obscure them at a given level, at a given moment. The race-tribe\n\nexists only at the level of an oppressed race, and in the name of the\n\noppression it suffers: there is no race but inferior, minoritarian; there is\n\nno dominant race; a race is defined not by its purity but rather by the\n\nimpurity conferred upon it by a system of domination. Bastard and\n\nmixed-blood are the true names of race. Rimbaud said it all on this point:\n\nonly he or she can invoke race who says, \"I have always been of an inferior\n\nrace... I am of an inferior race for all eternity. . . There I am on the\nBreton\n\nshore ... I am a beast, a nigger . . . I am of a distant race: my ancestors\nwere\n\nNorsemen.\"\n\n48\n\nIn the same way that race is not something to be rediscovered,\n\nthe Orient is not something to be imitated: it only exists in the construction\n\nof a smooth space, just as race only exists in the constitu-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)402.png)\n\n380 \u25a1 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\ntion of a tribe that peoples and traverses a smooth space.

As such, the war machine has three aspects, a spatiogeographic  \naspect, an arithmetic or algebraic aspect, and an affective aspect._\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nV. _Nomad existence necessarily effectuates the conditions _\n\n_of the war machine in space._\n\nThe nomad has a territory; he follows customary paths; he goes from\n\none point to another; he is not ignorant of points (water points, dwelling\n\npoints, assembly points, etc.). But the question is what in nomad life is a\n\nprinciple and what is only a consequence. To begin with, although the\n\npoints determine paths, they are strictly subordinated to the paths they\n\ndetermine, the reverse of what happens with the sedentary. The water\n\npoint is reached only in order to be left behind; every point is a relay and\n\nexists only as a relay. A path is always between two points, but the in-bet-\n\nween has taken on all the consistency and enjoys both an autonomy and a\n\ndirection of its own. The life of the nomad is the intermezzo. Even the ele-\n\nments of his dwelling are conceived in terms of the trajectory that is for-\n\never mobilizing them.\n\n49\n\nThe nomad is not at all the same as the migrant;\n\nfor the migrant goes principally from one point to another, even if the sec-\n\nond point is uncertain, unforeseen, or not well localized. But the nomad\n\ngoes from point to point only as a consequence and as a factual necessity;\n\nin principle, points for him are relays along a trajectory. Nomads and\n\nmigrants can mix in many ways, or form a common aggregate; their\n\ncauses and conditions are no less distinct for that (for example, those who\n\njoined Mohammed at Medina had a choice between a nomadic or bedouin\n\npledge, and a pledge of hegira or emigration).\n\n50\n\nSecond, even though the nomadic trajectory may follow trails or cus-\n\ntomary routes, it does not fulfill the function of the sedentary road, which\n\nis to _parcel out a closed space to people, _assigning each person a share and\n\nregulating the communication between shares. The nomadic trajectory\n\ndoes the opposite: it _distributes people (or animals) in an open space, _one\n\nthat is indefinite and noncommunicating. The _nomos _came to designate\n\nthe law, but that was originally because it was distribution, a mode of\ndistri-\n\nbution. It is a very special kind of distribution, one without division into\n\nshares, in a space without borders or enclosure. The _nomos _is the consis-\n\ntency of a fuzzy aggregate: it is in this sense that it stands in opposition\nto\n\nthe law or the _polls, _as the backcountry, a mountainside, or the vague\n\nexpanse around a city (\"either nomos or polis\").\n\n51\n\nTherefore, and this is the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)403.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 381\n\nthird point, there is a significant difference between the spaces: sedentary\n\nspace is striated, by walls, enclosures, and roads between enclosures, while\n\nnomad space is smooth, marked only by \"traits\" that are effaced and dis-\n\nplaced with the trajectory. Even the lamellae of the desert slide over each\n\nother, producing an inimitable sound. The nomad distributes himself in a\n\nsmooth space; he occupies, inhabits, holds that space; that is his territorial\n\nprinciple. It is therefore false to define the nomad by movement. Toynbee\n\nis profoundly right to suggest that the nomad is on the contrary _he who does  \nnot move. _Whereas the migrant leaves behind a milieu that has become\n\namorphous or hostile, the nomad is one who does not depart, does not want\n\nto depart, who clings to the smooth space left by the receding forest, where\n\nthe steppe or the desert advances, and who invents nomadism as a response\n\nto this challenge.\n\n52\n\nOf course, the nomad moves, but while seated, and he is\n\nonly seated while moving (the Bedouin galloping, knees on the saddle, sit-\n\nting on the soles of his upturned feet, \"a feat of balance\"). The nomad\n\nknows how to wait, he has infinite patience. Immobility and speed, catato-\n\nnia and rush, a \"stationary process,\" station as process\u2014these traits of\n\nKleist's are eminently those of the nomad. It is thus necessary to make a\n\ndistinction between _speed _and _movement: _a movement may be very fast,\n\nbut that does not give it speed; a speed may be very slow, or even immobile,\n\nyet it is still speed. Movement is extensive; speed is intensive. Movement\n\ndesignates the relative character of a body considered as \"one,\" and which\n\ngoes from point to point; _speed, on the contrary, constitutes the absolute  \ncharacter of a body whose irreducible parts (atoms) occupy or fill a smooth  \nspace in the manner of a vortex, _with the possibility of springing up at any\n\npoint. (It is therefore not surprising that reference has been made to spiri-\n\ntual voyages effected without relative movement, but in intensity, in one\n\nplace: these are part of nomadism.) In short, we will say by convention that\n\nonly nomads have absolute movement, in other words, speed; vortical or\n\nswirling movement is an essential feature of their war machine.\n\nIt is in this sense that nomads have no points, paths, or land, even though\n\nthey do by all appearances. If the nomad can be called the Deterritorialized\n\npar excellence, it is precisely because there is no reterritorialization\n_after-  \nward_as with the migrant, or upon _something else _as with the sedentary (the\n\nsedentary's relation with the earth is mediatized by something else, a prop-\n\nerty regime, a State apparatus). With the nomad, on the contrary, it is\n\ndeterritorialization that constitutes the relation to the earth, to such a\n\ndegree that the nomad reterritorializes on deterritorialization itself. It is\n\nthe earth that deterritorializes itself, in a way that provides the nomad with\n\na territory. The land ceases to be land, tending to become simply ground  \n_(sol) _or support. The earth does not become deterritorialized in its global\n\nand relative movement, but at specific locations, at the spot where the for-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)404.png)\n\n0\n\n382 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nest recedes, or where the steppe and the desert advance. Hubac is right to\n\nsay that nomadism is explainable less by universal changes in climate\n\n(which relate instead to migrations) as by the \"divagation of local cli-\n\nmates.\"\n\n53\n\nThe nomads are there, on the land, wherever there forms a\n\nsmooth space that gnaws, and tends to grow, in all directions. The nomads\n\ninhabit these places; they remain in them, and they themselves make them\n\ngrow, for it has been established that the nomads make the desert no less\n\nthan they are made by it. They are vectors of deterritorialization. They add\n\ndesert to desert, steppe to steppe, by a series of local operations whose ori-\n\nentation and direction endlessly vary.\n\n54\n\nThe sand desert has not only oases,\n\nwhich are like fixed points, but also rhizomatic vegetation that is tempo-\n\nrary and shifts location according to local rains, bringing changes in the\n\ndirection of the crossings.\n\n55\n\nThe same terms are used to describe ice deserts\n\nas sand deserts: there is no line separating earth and sky; there is no inter-\n\nmediate distance, no perspective or contour; visibility is limited; and yet\n\nthere is an extraordinarily fine topology that relies not on points or objects\n\nbut rather on haecceities, on sets of relations (winds, undulations of snow\n\nor sand, the song of the sand or the creaking of ice, the tactile qualities of\n\nboth). It is a tactile space, or rather \"haptic,\" a sonorous much more than a\n\nvisual space.\n\n56\n\nThe variability, the polyvocality of directions, is an essential\n\nfeature of smooth spaces of the rhizome type, and it alters their cartogra-\n\nphy. The nomad, nomad space, is localized and not delimited. What is both\n\nlimited and limiting is striated space, the _relative global: _it is limited\nin its\n\nparts, which are assigned constant directions, are oriented in relation to\n\none another, divisible by boundaries, and can interlink; what is limiting  \n_{limes _or wall, and no longer boundary) is this aggregate in relation to the\n\nsmooth spaces it \"contains,\" whose growth it slows or prevents, and which\n\nit restricts or places outside. Even when the nomad sustains its effects, he\n\ndoes not belong to this relative global, where one passes from one point to\n\nanother, from one region to another. Rather, he is in a _local absolute, _an\n\nabsolute that is manifested locally, and engendered in a series of local oper-\n\nations of varying orientations: desert, steppe, ice, sea.\n\nMaking the absolute appear in a particular place\u2014is that not a very gen-\n\neral characteristic of religion (recognizing that the nature of the appear-\n\nance, and the legitimacy, or lack thereof, of the images that reproduce it are\n\nopen to debate)? But the sacred place of religion is fundamentally a center\n\nthat repels the obscure _nomos. _The absolute of religion is essentially a\nhori-\n\nzon that encompasses, and, if the absolute itself appears at a particular\n\nplace, it does so in order to establish a solid and stable center for the\nglobal.\n\nThe encompassing role of smooth spaces (desert, steppe, or ocean) in\n\nmonotheism has been frequently noted. In short, religion converts the\n\nabsolute.

Limiting ourselves to this opposition between points of view, it may\n\nbe observed that nomads do not provide a favorable terrain for religion; the\n\nman of war is always committing an offense against the priest or the god.\n\nThe nomads have a vague, literally vagabond \"monotheism,\" and content\n\nthemselves with that, and with their ambulant fires. The nomads have a\n\nsense of the absolute, but a singularly atheistic one. The universalist reli-\n\ngions that have had dealings with nomads\u2014Moses, Mohammed, even\n\nChristianity with the Nestorian heresy\u2014have always encountered prob-\n\nlems in this regard, and have run up against what they have termed obsti-\n\nnate impiety. These religions are not, in effect, separable from a firm and\n\nconstant orientation, from an imperial de jure State, even, and especially,\n\nin the absence of a de facto State; they have promoted an ideal of\n\nsedentari-zation and addressed themselves more to the migrant components\n\nthan the nomadic ones. Even early Islam favored the theme of the hegira,\n\nor migration, over nomadism; rather, it was through certain schisms (such\n\nas the Kharijl movement) that it won over the Arab or Berber nomads.\n\n57\n\nHowever, it does not exhaust the question to establish a simple opposi-\n\ntion between two points of view, religion-nomadism. For monotheistic\n\nreligion, at the deepest level of its tendency to project a universal or\nspiri-\n\ntual State over the entire ecumenon, is not without ambivalence or fringe\n\nareas; it goes beyond even the ideal limits of the State, even the imperial\n\nState, entering a more indistinct zone, an outside of States where it has the\n\npossibility of undergoing a singular mutation or adaptation. We are refer-\n\nring to religion as an element in a war machine and the idea of holy war as\n\nthe motor of that machine. _The prophet, _as opposed to the state personality\n\nof the king and the religious personality of the priest, directs the movement\n\nby which a religion becomes a war machine or passes over to the side of\n\nsuch a machine. It has often been said that Islam, and the prophet Moham-\n\nmed, performed such a conversion of religion and constituted a veritable\n\nesprit de corps: in the formula of Georges Bataille, \"early Islam, a society\n\nreduced to the military enterprise.\" This is what the West invokes in order\n\nto justify its antipathy toward Islam. Yet the Crusades were a properly\n\nChristian adventure of this type. The prophets may very well condemn\n\nnomad life; the war machine may very well favor the movement of\n\nmigration and the ideal of establishment; religion in general may very well\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)406.png)\n\n0\n\n384 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\ncompensate for its specific deterritorialization with a spiritual and even\n\nphysical reterritorialization, which in the case of the holy war assumes the\n\nwell-directed character of a conquest of the holy lands as the center of the\n\nworld. Despite all that, when religion sets itself up as a war machine, it\n\nmobilizes and liberates a formidable charge of nomadism or absolute\n\ndeterritorialization; it doubles the migrant with an accompanying nomad,\n\nor with the potential nomad the migrant is in the process of becoming; and\n\nfinally, it turns its dream of an absolute State back against the State-form.\n\n58\n\nAnd this turning-against is no less a part of the \"essence\" of religion than\n\nthat dream. The history of the Crusades is marked by the most astonishing\n\nseries of directional changes: the firm orientation toward the Holy Land as\n\na center to reach often seems nothing more than a pretext. But it would be\n\nwrong to say that the play of self-interest, or economic, commercial, or\n\npolitical factors, diverted the crusade from its pure path. The idea of the\n\ncrusade _in itself implies this variability of directions, _broken and\nchanging,\n\nand intrinsically possesses all these factors or all these variables from the\n\nmoment it turns religion into a war machine and simultaneously utilizes\n\nand gives rise to the corresponding nomadism.\n\n59\n\nThe necessity of main-\n\ntaining the most rigorous of distinctions between sedentaries, migrants,\n\nand nomads does not preclude de facto mixes; on the contrary, it makes\n\nthem all the more necessary in turn. And it is impossible to think of the gen-\n\neral process of sedentarization that vanquished the nomads without also\n\nenvisioning the gusts of local nomadization that carried off sedentaries\n\nand doubled migrants (notably, to the benefit of religion).\n\nSmooth or nomad space lies between two striated spaces: that of the for-\n\nest, with its gravitational verticals, and that of agriculture, with its grids\n\nand generalized parallels, its now independent arborescence, its art of\n\nextracting the tree and wood from the forest. But being \"between\" also\n\nmeans that smooth space is controlled by these two flanks, which limit it,\n\noppose its development, and assign it as much as possible a\n\ncommunica-tional role; or, on the contrary, it means that it turns against\n\nthem, gnawing away at the forest on one side, on the other side gaining\n\nground on the cultivated lands, affirming a noncommunicating force or a\n\nforce of _divergence _like a \"wedge\" digging in. The nomads turn first\n\nagainst the forest and the mountain dwellers, then descend upon the\n\nfarmers. What we have here is something like the flipside or the outside\n\nof the State-form\u2014but in what sense? This form, as a global and relative\n\nspace, implies a certain number of components: forest-clearing of fields;\n\nagriculture-grid laying; animal raising subordinated to agricultural work\n\nand sedentary food production; commerce based on a constellation of\n\ntown-country _(polis-nomos) _communications.

Quite to the contrary, a more rigid agency becomes\n\nnecessary in order to retain and reunite the various components plied by\n\nescape vectors. States always have the same composition; if there is even\n\none truth in the political philosophy of Hegel, it is that every State carries\n\nwithin itself the essential moments of its existence. States are made up not\n\nonly of people but also of wood, fields, gardens, animals, and commodities.\n\nThere is a unity of _composition _of all States, but States have neither the\n\nsame _development _nor the same _organization. _In the Orient, the compo-\n\nnents are much more disconnected, disjointed, necessitating a great immu-\n\ntable Form to hold them together: \"despotic formations,\" Asian or African,\n\nare rocked by incessant revolts, by secessions and dynastic changes, which\n\nnevertheless do not affect the immutability of the form. In the West, on the\n\nother hand, the interconnectedness of the components makes possible\n\ntransformations of the State-form through revolution. It is true that the\n\nidea of revolution itself is ambiguous; it is Western insofar as it relates to\na\n\ntransformation of the State, but Eastern insofar as it envisions the destruc-\n\ntion, the abolition of the State.\n\n61\n\nThe great empires of the Orient, Africa,\n\nand America run up against wide-open smooth spaces that penetrate them\n\nand maintain gaps between their components (the _nomos _does not become\n\ncountryside, the countryside does not communicate with the town,\n\nlarge-scale animal raising is the affair of the nomads, etc.): the oriental\n\nState is in direct confrontation with a nomad war machine. This war\n\nmachine may fall back to the road of integration and proceed solely by\n\nrevolt and dynastic change; nevertheless, it is the war machine, as nomad,\n\nthat invents the abolitionist dream and reality. Western States are much\n\nmore sheltered in their striated space and consequently have much more\n\nlatitude in holding their components together; they confront the nomads\n\nonly indirectly, through the intermediary of the migrations the nomads\n\ntrigger or adopt as their stance.\n\n62\n\nOne of the fundamental tasks of the State is to striate the space over\n\nwhich it reigns, or to utilize smooth spaces as a means of communication in\n\nthe service of striated space. It is a vital concern of every State not only\nto\n\nvanquish nomadism but to control migrations and, more generally, to\n\nestablish a zone of rights over an entire \"exterior,\" over all of the flows\n\ntraversing the ecumenon.

Speed and absolute movement are not\n\nwithout their laws, but they are the laws of the _nomos, _of the smooth space\n\nthat deploys it, of the war machine that populates it. If the nomads formed\n\nthe war machine, it was by inventing absolute speed, by being \"synony-\n\nmous\" with speed. And each time there is an operation against the State\u2014\n\ninsubordination, rioting, guerrilla warfare, or revolution as act\u2014it can be\n\nsaid that a war machine has revived, that a new nomadic potential has\n\nappeared, accompanied by the reconstitution of a smooth space or a man-\n\nner of being in space as though it were smooth (Virilio discusses the impor-\n\ntance of the riot or revolutionary theme of \"holding the street\"). It is in\nthis\n\nsense that the response of the State against all that threatens to move\n\nbeyond it is to striate space. The State does not appropriate the war\n\nmachine without giving even it the form of relative movement: this was the\n\ncase with the model of the _fortress _as a regulator of movement, which was\n\nprecisely the obstacle the nomads came up against, the stumbling block\n\nand parry by which absolute vortical movement was broken. Conversely,\n\nwhen a State does not succeed in striating its interior or neighboring space,\n\nthe flows traversing that State necessarily adopt the stance of a war\n\nmachine directed against it, deployed in a hostile or rebellious smooth\n\nspace (even if other States are able to slip their striations in). This was\nthe\n\nadventure of China: toward the end of the fourteenth century, and in spite\n\nof its very high level of technology in ships and navigation, it turned its\n\nback on its huge maritime space, saw its commercial flows turn against it\n\nand ally themselves with piracy, and was unable to react except by a politics\n\nof immobility, of the massive restriction of commerce, which only\n\nreinforced the connection between commerce and the war machine.\n\n64\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)409.png)\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE D 387\n\nThe situation is much more complicated than we have let on. The sea is\n\nperhaps principal among smooth spaces, the hydraulic model par excel-\n\nlence. But the sea is also, of all smooth spaces, the first one attempts were\n\nmade to striate, to transform into a dependency of the land, with its fixed\n\nroutes, constant directions, relative movements, a whole counterhydraulic\n\nof channels and conduits. One of the reasons for the hegemony of the West\n\nwas the power of its State apparatuses to striate the sea by combining the\n\ntechnologies of the North and the Mediterranean and by annexing the\n\nAtlantic. But this undertaking had the most unexpected result: the multi-\n\nplication of relative movements, the intensification of relative speeds in\n\nstriated space, ended up reconstituting a smooth space or absolute move-\n\nment. As Virilio emphasizes, the sea became the place of _the fleet in being,\n_\n\nwhere one no longer goes from one point to another, but rather holds space\n\nbeginning from any point: instead of striating space, one occupies it with a\n\nvector of deterritorialization in perpetual motion. This modern strategy\n\nwas communicated from the sea to the air, as the new smooth space, but\n\nalso to the entire Earth considered as desert or sea. As converter and\n\ncapturer, the State does not just relativize movement, it reimparts absolute\n\nmovement. It does not just go from the smooth to the striated, it reconsti-\n\ntutes smooth space; it reimparts smooth in the wake of the striated. It is\n\ntrue that this new nomadism accompanies a worldwide war machine\n\nwhose organization exceeds the State apparatuses and passes into energy,\n\nmilitary-industrial, and multinational complexes. We say this as a\n\nreminder that smooth space and the form of exteriority do not have an irre-\n\nsistible revolutionary calling but change meaning drastically depending on\n\nthe interactions they are part of and the concrete conditions of their exer-\n\ncise or establishment (for example, the way in which total war and popular\n\nwar, and even guerrilla warfare, borrow one another's methods).\n\n65\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nVI. _Nomad existence necessarily implies the numerical _\n\n_elements of a war machine._\n\nTens, hundreds, thousands, myriads: all armies retain these decimal\n\ngroupings, to the point that each time they are encountered it is safe to\n\nassume the presence of a military organization. Is this not the way an army\n\ndeterritorializes its soldiers? An army is composed of units, companies,\n\nand divisions. The Numbers may vary in function, in combination; they\n\nmay enter into entirely different strategies; but there is always a connection\n\nbetween the Number and the war machine. It is a question not of quantity\n\nbut of organization or composition. When the State creates armies, it\n\nalways applies this principle of numerical organization; but all it does is\n\nadopt the principle, at the same time as it appropriates the war machine.\n\nFor so peculiar an idea\u2014the numerical organization of people\u2014came\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)410.png)\n\n0\n\n388 D\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nfrom the nomads. It was the Hyksos, conquering nomads, who brought it to\n\nEgypt; and when Moses applied it to his people in exodus, it was on the\n\nadvice of his nomad father-in-law, Jethro the Kenite, and was done in such\n\na way as to constitute a war machine, the elements of which are described in\n\nthe biblical book of Numbers. The _nomos _is fundamentally numerical,\n\narithmetic. When Greek geometrism is contrasted with Indo-Arab\n\narithmetism, it becomes clear that the latter implies a nomos opposable to\n\nthe logos: not that the nomads \"do\" arithmetic or algebra, but because\n\narithmetic and algebra arise in a strongly nomad influenced world.\n\nUp to now we have known three major types of human organization: _lin-_\n\n_eal, territorial, _and _numerical. _Lineal organization allows us to define\n\nso-called primitive societies. Clan lineages are essentially segments in\n\naction; they meld and divide, and vary according to the ancestor consid-\n\nered, the tasks, and the circumstances. Of course, number plays an impor-\n\ntant role in the determination of lineage, or in the creation of new\n\nlineages\u2014as does the earth, since a clan segmentarity is doubled by a tribal\n\nsegmentarity. The earth is before all else the matter upon which the\n\ndynamic of lineages is inscribed, and the number, a means of inscription:\n\nthe lineages write upon the earth and with the number, constituting a kind\n\nof \"geodesy.\" Everything changes with State societies: it is often said that\n\nthe territorial principle becomes dominant. One could also speak of\n\ndeterritorialization, since the earth becomes an object, instead of being an\n\nactive material element in combination with lineage. Property is precisely\n\nthe deterritorialized relation between the human being and the earth; this\n\nis so whether property constitutes a good belonging to the State,\n\nsuperposed upon continuing possession by a lineal community, or whether\n\nit itself becomes a good belonging to private individuals constituting a new\n\ncommunity. In both cases (and according to the two poles of the State),\n\nsomething like an overcoding of the earth replaces geodesy. Of course, line-\n\nages remain very important, and numbers take on their own importance.\n\nBut what moves to the forefront is a \"territorial\" organization, in the sense\n\nthat all the segments, whether of lineage, land, or number, are taken up by  \n_an astronomical space or a geometrical extension _that overcodes them\u2014\n\nbut certainly not in the same way in the archaic imperial State and in mod-\n\nern States. The archaic State envelops a _spatium _with a summit, a\n\ndifferentiated space with depth and levels, whereas modern States (begin-\n\nning with the Greek city-state) develop a homogeneous _extensio _with an\n\nimmanent center, divisible homologous parts, and symmetrical and\n\nreversible relations. Not only do the two models, the astronomical and the\n\ngeometrical, enter into intimate mixes, but even when they are supposedly\n\npure, both imply the subordination of lineages and numbers to this metric\n\npower, as it appears either in the _imperial spatium _or in the _political_\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)411.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE D 389\n\n_extension _Arithmetic, the number, has always had a decisive role in the\n\nState apparatus: this is so even as early as the imperial bureaucracy, with\n\nthe three conjoined operations of the census, taxation, and election. It is\n\neven truer of modern forms of the State, which in developing utilized all\n\nthe calculation techniques that were springing up at the border between\n\nmathematical science and social technology (there is a whole social calcu-\n\nlus at the basis of political economy, demography, the organization of\n\nwork, etc.). This arithmetic element of the State found its specific power in\n\nthe treatment of all kinds of matter: primary matters (raw materials), the\n\nsecondary matter of wrought objects, or the ultimate matter constituted by\n\nthe human population. Thus the number has always served to gain mastery\n\nover matter, to control its variations and movements, in other words, to\n\nsubmit them to the spatiotemporal framework of the State\u2014either the\n\nimperial _spatium, _or the modern _extensio._\n\n_61_\n\n_ _The State has a territorial\n\nprinciple, or a principle of deterritorialization, that links the number to\n\nmetric magnitudes (taking into account the increasingly complex metrics\n\neffecting the overcoding). We do not believe that the conditions of inde-\n\npendence or autonomy of the Number are to be found in the State, even\n\nthough all the factors of its development are present.\n\nThe _Numbering Number, _in other words, autonomous arithmetic organ-\n\nization, implies neither a superior degree of abstraction nor very large\n\nquantities. It relates only to conditions of possibility constituted by\n\nnomadism and to conditions of effectuation constituted by the war\n\nmachine. It is in State armies that the problem of the treatment of large\n\nquantities arises, in relation to other matters; but the war machine operates\n\nwith small quantities that it treats using numbering numbers. These num-\n\nbers appear as soon as one distributes something in space, instead of divid-\n\ning up space or distributing space itself. The number becomes a subject.\n\nThe independence of the number in relation to space is a result not of\n\nabstraction but of the concrete nature of smooth space, which is occupied\n\nwithout itself being counted. The number is no longer a means of counting\n\nor measuring but of moving: it is the number itself that moves through\n\nsmooth space. There is undoubtedly a geometry of smooth space: but as we\n\nhave seen, it is a minor, operative geometry, a geometry of the trait. The\n\nmore independent space is from a metrics, the more independent the num-\n\nber is from space. Geometry as a royal science has little importance for the\n\nwar machine (its only importance is in State armies, and for sedentary for-\n\ntification, but it leads generals to serious defeats).\n\n68\n\nThe number becomes a\n\nprinciple whenever it occupies a smooth space, and is deployed within it as\n\nsubject, instead of measuring a striated space.

A complex of numbers every time.\n\nIt is exactly for this reason that it in no way implies large, homogenized\n\nquantities, like State numbers or the numbered number, but rather pro-\n\nduces its effect of immensity by its fine articulation, in other words, by its\n\ndistribution of heterogeneity in a free space. Even State armies do not do\n\naway with this principle when they deal with large numbers (despite the\n\npredominance of \"base\" 10). The Roman legion was a number made up of\n\nnumbers, articulated in such a way that the segments became mobile, and\n\nthe figures geometrical, changing, transformational. The complex or artic-\n\nulated number comprises not only men but necessarily weapons, animals,\n\nand vehicles. The arithmetic base unit is therefore a unit of assemblage, for\n\nexample, man-horse-bow, lxl X 1, according to the formula that carried the\n\nScythians to triumph; and the formula becomes more complicated to the\n\nextent that certain \"weapons\" assemble or articulate several men or\n\nanimals, as in the case of the chariot with two horses and two men, one to\n\ndrive and the other to throw, 2 X 1 X 2 = 1; or in the case of the famous\n\ntwo-handled shield of the hoplite reform, which soldered together human\n\nchains. However small the unit, it is articulated. The numbering number\n\nalways has several bases at the same time. It is also necessary to take into\n\naccount arithmetic relations that are external yet still contained in the\n\nnumber, expressing the proportion of combatants among the members of a\n\nlineage or tribe, the role of reserves and stocks, the upkeep of people,\n\nthings, and animals. _Logistics _is the art of these external relations, which\n\nare no less a part of the war machine than the internal relations _of\nstrategy, _\n\nin other words, the composition of combat units in relation to one another.\n\nThe two together constitute the science of the articulation of numbers of\n\nwar. Every assemblage has this strategic aspect and this logistical aspect.\n\nBut the numbering number has a second, more secret, characteristic.\n\nEverywhere, the war machine displays a curious process of arithmetic rep-\n\nlication or doubling, as if it operated along two nonsymmetrical and\n\nnonequal series. _On the one hand, _the lineages are indeed organized and\n\nreshuffled numerically; a numerical composition is superimposed upon\n\nthe lineages in order to bring the new principle into predominance. But _on  \nthe other hand, _men are simultaneously extracted from each lineage to\n\nform a special numerical body\u2014as if the new numerical composition of\n\nthe lineage-body could not succeed without the constitution of a body\n\nproper to it, itself numerical.

For the social body\n\nto be numerized, the number must form a special body. When Genghis\n\nKhan undertook his great composition of the steppe, he numerically or-\n\nganized the lineages, and the fighters in each lineage, placing them under a\n\ncipher and a chief (groups of ten with decurions, groups of one hundred\n\nwith centurions, groups of one thousand with chiliarchs). He also extracted\n\nfrom each arithmetized lineage a small number of men who were to consti-\n\ntute his personal guard, in other words, a dynamic formation comprising a\n\nstaff, commissars, messengers, and diplomats (\"antrustions\").\n\n71\n\nOne is\n\nnever without the other: a double deterritorialization, the second of which\n\nis to a higher power. When Moses undertook his great composition of the\n\ndesert\u2014where the influence he felt from the nomads was necessarily\n\nstronger than that of Yahweh\u2014he took a census of each tribe and or-\n\nganized them numerically; he also decreed a law according to which the\n\nfirstborn of each tribe at that particular time belonged by right to Yahweh.\n\nAs these firstborn were obviously still too young, their role in the Number\n\nwas transferred to a special tribe, the Levites, who provided the body of the\n\nNumber or the special guard of the ark; and as the Levites were less numer-\n\nous than the new firstborn of the tribes taken together, the excess firstborn\n\nhad to be bought back by the tribes in the form of taxes (bringing us back to\n\na fundamental aspect of logistics). The war machine would be unable to\n\nfunction without this double series: it is necessary both that numerical\n\ncomposition replace lineal organization and that it conjure away the ter-\n\nritorial organization of the State. Power in the war machine is defined ac-\n\ncording to this double series: power is no longer based on segments and\n\ncenters, on the potential resonance of centers and overcoding of segments,\n\nbut on these relations internal to the Number and independent of quantity.\n\nTensions or power struggles are also a result of this: between Moses' tribes\n\nand the Levites, between Genghis's \"noyans\" and \"antrustions.\" This is\n\nnot simply a protest on the part of lineages wishing to regain their former\n\nautonomy; nor is it the prefiguration of a struggle for control over a State\n\napparatus. It is a tension inherent in the war machine, in its special power,\n\nand in the particular limitations placed on the power of the \"chief.\"\n\nThus numerical composition, or the numbering number, implies several\n\noperations: the arithmetization of the starting aggregates or sets (the line-\n\nages); the union of the extracted subsets (the constitution of groups often,\n\none hundred, etc.); and the formation by substitution of another set in cor-\n\nrespondence with the united set (the special body). It is this last operation\n\nthat implies the most variety and originality in nomad existence. The same\n\nproblem arises even in State armies, when the war machine is appropriated\n\nby the State.

It is clear, especially in the last example, how the special body\nis\n\ninstituted as an element determinant of power in the war machine. The war\n\nmachine and nomadic existence have to ward off two things simultane-\n\nously: a return of the lineal aristocracy and the formation of imperial\n\nfunctionaries. What complicates everything is that the State itself has often\n\nbeen determined in such a way as to use slaves as high functionaries. As we\n\nshall see, the reasons for this varied, and although the two currents con-\n\nverged in armies, they came from two distinct sources. For the power of\n\nslaves, foreigners, or captives in a war machine of nomadic origin is very\n\ndifferent from the power of lineal aristocracies, as well as from that of\nState\n\nfunctionaries and bureaucrats. They are \"commissars,\" emissaries, diplo-\n\nmats, spies, strategists, and logisticians, sometimes smiths. They cannot be\n\nexplained away as a \"whim of the sultan.\" On the contrary, it is the possibil-\n\nity of the war chief having whims that is explained by the objective exis-\n\ntence and necessity of this special numerical body, this Cipher that has\n\nvalue only in relation to a _nomos. _There is both a deterritorialization and\na\n\nbecoming proper to the war machine; the special body, in particular the\n\nslave-infidel-foreigner, is the one who _becomes _a soldier and believer while\n\nremaining deterritorialized in relation to the lineages and the State. You\n\nhave to be born an infidel to become a believer; you have to be born a slave\n\nto become a soldier. Specific schools or institutions are needed for this pur-\n\npose: the special body is an invention proper to the war machine, which\n\nStates always utilize, adapting it so totally to their own ends that it\nbecomes\n\nunrecognizable, or restituting it in bureaucratic staff form, or in the tech-\n\nnocratic form of very special bodies, or in \"esprit de corps\" that serve the\n\nState as much as they resist it, or among the commissars who double the\n\nState as much as they serve it.\n\nIt is true that the nomads have no history; they only have a geography.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)416.png)\n\n0\n\n394 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nAnd the defeat of the nomads was such, so complete, that history is one\n\nwith the triumph of States. We have witnessed, as a result, a generalized cri-\n\ntique dismissing the nomads as incapable of any innovation, whether tech-\n\nnological or metallurgical, political or metaphysical. Historians, bourgeois\n\nor Soviet (Grousset or Vladimirtsov), consider the nomads a pitiable seg-\n\nment of humanity that understands nothing: not technology, to which it\n\nsupposedly remained indifferent; not agriculture, not the cities and States\n\nit destroyed or conquered. It is difficult to see, however, how the nomads\n\ncould have triumphed in war if they did not possess strong metallurgical\n\ncapabilities (the idea that the nomads received their technical weapons and\n\npolitical counseling from renegades from an imperial State is highly im-\n\nprobable). It is difficult to see how the nomads could have undertaken to\n\ndestroy cities and States, except in the name of a nomad organization and a\n\nwar machine defined not by ignorance but by their positive characteristics,\n\nby their specific space, by a composition all their own that broke with line-\n\nages and warded off the State-form. History has always dismissed the\n\nnomads. Attempts have been made to apply a properly military category to\n\nthe war machine (that of \"military democracy\") and a properly sedentary\n\ncategory to nomadism (that of \"feudalism\"). But these two hypotheses pre-\n\nsuppose a territorial principle: either that an imperial State appropriates\n\nthe war machine, distributing land to warriors as a benefit of their position  \n_(cleroi _and false fiefs), or that property, once it has become private, in\nitself\n\nposits relations of dependence among the property owners constituting the\n\narmy (true fiefs and vassalage).\n\n73\n\nIn both cases, the number is subordinated\n\nto an \"immobile\" fiscal organization, in order to establish which land can\n\nbe or has been ceded, as well as to set the taxes owed by the beneficiaries\n\nthemselves. There is no doubt that nomad organization and the war\n\nmachine deal with these same problems, both the level of land and of taxa-\n\ntion (in which the nomadic warriors were great innovators, despite what is\n\nsaid to the contrary). But they invent a territoriality and a \"movable\" fiscal\n\norganization that testify to the autonomy of a numerical principle: there\n\ncan be a confusion or combination of the systems, but the specificity of the\n\nnomadic system remains the subordination of land to numbers that are\n\ndisplaced and deployed, and of taxation to relations internal to those num-\n\nbers (already with Moses, for example, taxation played a role in the relation\n\nbetween the numerical bodies and the special body of the number).

As a first approximation, weapons have a privileged relation with\n\nprojection. Anything that throws or is thrown is fundamentally a weapon,\n\nand propulsion is its essential moment. The weapon is ballistic; the very\n\nnotion of the \"problem\" is related to the war machine. The more mecha-\n\nnisms of projection a tool has, the more it behaves like a weapon, poten-\n\ntially or simply metaphorically. In addition, tools are constantly compen-\n\nsating for the projective mechanisms they possess, or else they adapt them\n\nto other ends. It is true that missile weapons, in the strict sense, whether\n\nprojected or projecting, are only one kind among others; but even hand-\n\nheld weapons require a usage of the hand and arm different from that\n\nrequired by tools, a projective usage exemplified in the martial arts. The\n\ntool, on the other hand, is much more introceptive, introjective: it prepares\n\na matter from a distance, in order to bring it to a state of equilibrium or to\n\nappropriate it for a form of interiority. Action at a distance exists in both\n\ncases, but in one case it is centrifugal and in the other, centripetal. One\n\ncould also say that the tool encounters resistances, to be conquered or put\n\nto use, while the weapon has to do with counterattack, to be avoided or\n\ninvented (the counterattack is in fact the precipitating and inventive factor\n\nin the war machine, to the extent that it is not simply reducible to a quanti-\n\ntative rivalry or defensive parade).\n\nSecond, weapons and tools do not \"tendentially\" (approximately) have\n\nthe same relation to movement, to speed. It is yet another essential contri-\n\nbution of Paul Virilio to have stressed this weapon-speed complemen-\n\ntarity: the weapon invents speed, or the discovery of speed invents the\n\nweapon (the projective character of weapons is the result). The war\n\nmachine releases a vector of speed so specific to it that it needs a special\n\nname; it is not only the power of destruction, but \"dromocracy\" (= _nomos). _\n\nAmong other advantages, this idea articulates a new mode of distinction\n\nbetween the hunt and war.

As Virilio says, war in no way appears when man\n\napplies to man the relation of the _hunter _to the animal, but on the contrary\n\nwhen he captures the force of the _hunted _animal and enters an entirely new\n\nrelation to man, that of war (enemy, no longer prey). It is therefore not sur-\n\nprising that the war machine was the invention of the animal-raising\n\nnomads: animal breeding and training are not to be confused either with\n\nthe primitive hunt or with sedentary domestication, but are in fact the dis-\n\ncovery of a projecting and projectile system. Rather than operating by\n\nblow-by-blow violence, or constituting a violence \"once and for all,\" the\n\nwar machine, with breeding and training, institutes an entire economy of\n\nviolence, in other words, a way of making violence durable, even unlim-\n\nited. \"Bloodletting, immediate killing, run contrary to the unlimited usage\n\nof violence, that is, to its economy.... _The economy of violence is not that\nof  \nthe hunter in the animal raiser, but that of the hunted animal. _In horseback\n\nriding, one conserves the kinetic energy, the speed of the horse, and no\n\nlonger its proteins (the motor, and no longer the flesh).. . . Whereas in the\n\nhunt the hunter's aim was to arrest the movement of wild animality\n\nthrough systematic slaughter, the animal breeder [sets about] conserving it,\n\nand, by means of training, the rider joins with this movement, orienting it\n\nand provoking its acceleration.\" The technological motor would develop\n\nthis tendency further, but \"horseback riding was the first projector of the\n\nwarrior, his first system of arms.\"\n\n75\n\nWhence becoming-animal in the war\n\nmachine. Does this mean that the war machine did not exist before horse-\n\nback riding and the cavalry? That is not the issue. The issue is that the war\n\nmachine implies the release of a Speed vector that becomes a free or inde-\n\npendent variable; this does not occur in the hunt, where speed is associated\n\nprimarily with the hunted animal. It is possible for this race vector to be\n\nreleased in an infantry, without recourse to horseback riding; it is possible,\n\nmoreover, for there to be horseback riding, but as a means of transporta-\n\ntion or even of portage having nothing to do with the free vector. In any\n\nevent, what the warrior borrows from the animal is more the idea of the\n\nmotor than the model of the prey. He does not generalize the idea of the\n\nprey by applying it to the enemy; he abstracts the idea of the motor, apply-\n\ning it to himself.\n\nTwo objections immediately arise. According to the first, the war\n\nmachine possesses as much weight and gravity as it does speed (the distinc-\n\ntion between the heavy and the light, the dissymmetry between defense and\n\nattack, the opposition between rest and tension). But it would be easy to\n\ndemonstrate that phenomena of \"temporization,\" and even of immobility\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)419.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 397\n\nand catatonia, so important in wars, relate in certain cases to a component\n\nof pure speed. And the rest of the time, they relate to the conditions under\n\nwhich State apparatuses appropriate the war machine, notably by arrang-\n\ning a striated space where opposing forces can come to an equilibrium. It\n\ncan happen that speed is abstracted as the property of a projectile, a bullet\n\nor artillery shell, which condemns the weapon itself, and the soldier, to\n\nimmobility (for example, immobility in the First World War). But an equi-\n\nlibrium of forces is a phenomenon of resistance, whereas the counterattack\n\nimplies a rush or change of speed that breaks the equilibrium: it was the\n\ntank that regrouped all of the operations in the speed vector and recreated a\n\nsmooth space for movement by uprooting men and arms.\n\n76\n\nThe opposite objection is more complex: it is that speed does indeed\n\nseem to be as much a part of the tool as of the weapon, and is no way specific\n\nto the war machine. The history of the motor is not only military. But per-\n\nhaps there is too much of a tendency to think in terms of quantities of\n\nmovement, instead of seeking qualitative models. The two ideal models of\n\nthe motor are those of work and _free action. _Work is a motor cause that\n\nmeets resistances, operates upon the exterior, is consumed and spent in its\n\neffect, and must be renewed from one moment to the next. Free action is\n\nalso a motor cause, but one that has no resistance to overcome, operates\n\nonly upon the mobile body itself, is not consumed in its effect, and contin-\n\nues from one moment to the next. Whatever its measure or degree, speed is\n\nrelative in the first case, absolute in the second (the idea of a _perpetuum  \nmobile). _In work, what counts is the point of application of a resultant\nforce\n\nexerted by the weight of a body considered as \"one\" (gravity), and the rela-\n\ntive displacement of this point of application. In free action, what counts is\n\nthe way in which the elements of the body escape gravitation to occupy\n\nabsolutely a nonpunctuated space. Weapons and weapon handling seem to\n\nbe linked to a free-action model, and tools to a work model. Linear dis-\n\nplacement, from one point to another, constitutes the relative movement\n\nof the tool, but it is the vortical occupation of a space that constitutes the\n\nabsolute movement of the weapon. It is as though the weapon were moving,\n\nself-propelling, while the tool is moved. This link between tools and work\n\nremains obscured unless work receives the motor, or real, definition we\n\nhave just given it. The tool does not define work; just the opposite. The tool\n\npresupposes work. It must be added that weapons, also, obviously imply a\n\nrenewal of the cause, an expending or even disappearance in the effect, the\n\nencountering of external resistances, a displacement of force, etc. It would\n\nbe futile to credit weapons with a magical power in contrast to the con-\n\nstraints of tools: weapons and tools are subject to the same laws, which\n\ndefine, precisely, their common sphere. But the principle behind all tech-\n\nnology is to demonstrate that a technical element remains abstract,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)420.png)\n\n0\n\n398 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nentirely undetermined, as long as one does not relate it to an _assemblage _it\n\npresupposes. It is the machine that is primary in relation to the technical\n\nelement: not the technical machine, itself a collection of elements, but the\n\nsocial or collective machine, the machinic assemblage that determines\n\nwhat is a technical element at a given moment, what is its usage, extension,\n\ncomprehension, etc.\n\nIt is through the intermediary of assemblages that the _phylum _selects,\n\nqualifies, and even invents the technical elements. Thus one cannot speak\n\nof weapons or tools before defining the constituent assemblages they pre-\n\nsuppose and enter into. This is what we meant when we said that weapons\n\nand tools are not merely distinguished from one another in an extrinsic\n\nmanner, and yet they have no distinctive intrinsic characteristics. They\n\nhave internal (and not intrinsic) characteristics relating to the respective\n\nassemblages with which they are associated. What effectuates a free-action\n\nmodel is not the weapons in themselves and in their physical aspect but the\n\n\"war machine\" assemblage as formal cause of the weapons. And what\n\neffectuates the work model is not the tools but the \"work machine\" assem-\n\nblage as formal cause of the tools. When we say that the weapon is insepara-\n\nble from a speed vector, while the tool remains tied to conditions of gravity,\n\nwe are claiming only to signal a difference between two types of assem-\n\nblage, a distinction that holds even if in the assemblage proper to it the\ntool\n\nis abstractly \"faster,\" and the weapon abstractly \"weightier.\" The tool is\n\nessentially tied to a genesis, a displacement, and an expenditure of force\n\nwhose laws reside in work, while the weapon concerns only the exercise or\n\nmanifestation of force in space and time, in conformity with free action.\n\nThe weapon does not fall from the sky, and obviously assumes production,\n\ndisplacement, expenditure, and resistance. But this aspect relates to the\n\ncommon sphere of the weapon and the tool, and does not yet concern the\n\nspecificity of the weapon, which appears only when force is considered in\n\nitself, when it is no longer tied to anything but the number, movement,\n\nspace, or time, or _when speed is added to displacement._\n\n_11_\n\n_ _Concretely, a\n\nweapon as such relates not to the Work model but to the Free-Action\n\nmodel, with the assumption that the conditions of work are fulfilled else-\n\nwhere. In short, from the point of view of force, the tool is tied to a\n\ngravity-displacement, weight-height system, and the weapon to a  \n_speed-perpetuum mobile _system (it is in this sense that it can be said that\n\nspeed in itself is a \"weapons system\").\n\nThe very general primacy of the collective and machinic assemblage\n\nover the technical element applies generally, for tools as for weapons.\n\nWeapons and tools are consequences, nothing but consequences.

The lance and the sword\n\ncame into being in the Bronze Age only by virtue of the man-horse assem-\n\nblage, which caused a lengthening of the dagger and pike, and made the\n\nfirst infantry weapons, the morning star and the battle-ax, obsolete. The\n\nstirrup, in turn, occasioned a new figure of the man-horse assemblage,\n\nentailing a new type of lance and new weapons; and this man-horse-stirrup\n\nconstellation is itself variable, and has different effects depending on\n\nwhether it is bound up with the general conditions of nomadism, or later\n\nreadapted to the sedentary conditions of feudalism. The situation is\n\nexactly the same for the tool: once again, everything depends on an organi-\n\nzation of work, and variable assemblages of human, animal, and thing.\n\nThus the heavy plow exists as a specific tool only in a constellation where\n\n\"long open fields\" predominate, where the horse tends to replace the ox as\n\ndraft animal, where the land begins to undergo triennial rotation, and\n\nwhere the economy becomes communal. Beforehand, the heavy plow may\n\nwell have existed, but on the margins of other assemblages that did not\n\nbring out its specificity, that left unexploited its differential character\nwith\n\nthe scratch plow.\n\n79\n\nAssemblages are passional, they are compositions of desire. Desire has\n\nnothing to do with a natural or spontaneous determination; there is no\n\ndesire but assembling, assembled, desire. The rationality, the efficiency, of\n\nan assemblage does not exist without the passions the assemblage brings into\n\nplay, without the desires that constitute it as much as it constitutes them.\n\nDetienne has shown that the Greek phalanx was inseparable from a whole\n\nreversal of values, and from a passional mutation that drastically changed\n\nthe relations between desire and the war machine. It is a case of man\n\ndismounting from the horse, and of the man-animal relation being\n\nreplaced by a relation between men in an infantry assemblage that paves\n\nthe way for the advent of the peasant-soldier, the citizen-soldier: the entire\n\nEros of war changes, a group homosexual Eros tends to replace the\n\nzoosexual Eros of the horseman. Undoubtedly, whenever a State appropri-\n\nates the war machine, it tends to assimilate the education of the citizen to\n\nthe training of the worker to the apprenticeship of the soldier. But if it is\n\ntrue that all assemblages are assemblages of desire, the question is whether\n\nthe assemblages of war and work, considered in themselves, do not funda-\n\nmentally mobilize passions of different orders.

This is the passional regime of feeling as \"the\n\nform of the worker.\" Feeling implies an evaluation of matter and its resis-\n\ntances, a direction _(sens, _also \"meaning\") to form and its developments, an\n\neconomy of force and its displacements, an entire gravity. But the regime of\n\nthe war machine is on the contrary that _of affects, _which relate only to the\n\nmoving body in itself, to speeds and compositions of speed among ele-\n\nments. Affect is the active discharge of emotion, the counterattack,\n\nwhereas feeling is an always displaced, retarded, resisting emotion. Affects\n\nare projectiles just like weapons; feelings are introceptive like tools. There\n\nis a relation between the affect and the weapon, as witnessed not only in\n\nmythology but also in the _chanson degeste, _and the chivalric novel or novel\n\nof courtly love. Weapons are affects and affects weapons. From this stand-\n\npoint, the most absolute immobility, pure catatonia, is a part of the speed\n\nvector, is carried by this vector, which links the petrification of the act to\n\nthe precipitation of movement. The knight sleeps on his mount, then\n\ndeparts like an arrow. Kleist is the author who best integrated these sudden\n\ncatatonic fits, swoons, suspenses, with the utmost speeds of a war machine.\n\nHe presents us with a becoming-weapon of the technical element simulta-\n\nneous to a becoming-affect of the passional element (the Penthesilea equa-\n\ntion). The martial arts have always subordinated weapons to speed, and\n\nabove all to mental (absolute) speed; for this reason, they are also the arts\nof\n\nsuspense and immobility. The affect passes through both extremes. Thus\n\nthe martial arts do not adhere to a _code, _as an affair of the State, but\nfollow  \n_ways, _which are so many paths of the affect; upon these ways, one learns to\n\n\"unuse\" weapons as much as one learns to use them, as if the power and cul-\n\ntivation of the affect were the true goal of the assemblage, the weapon being\n\nonly a provisory means. Learning to undo things, and to undo oneself, is\n\nproper to the war machine: the \"not-doing\" of the warrior, the undoing of\n\nthe subject. A movement of decoding runs through the war machine, while\n\novercoding solders the tool to an organization of work and of the State (the\n\ntool is never unlearned; one can only compensate for its absence). It is true\n\nthat the martial arts continually invoke the center of gravity and the rules\n\nfor its displacement. That is because these ways are not the ultimate ones.\n\nHowever far they go, they are still in the domain of Being, and only trans-\n\nlate absolute movements of another nature into the common space\u2014those\n\neffectuated in the Void, not in nothingness, but in the smooth of the void\n\nwhere there is no longer any goal: attacks, counterattacks, and headlong\n\nplunges.\n\n80\n\nStill from the standpoint of the assemblage, there is an essential relation\n\nbetween tools and signs.

The technical element becomes a tool when it is abstracted\n\nfrom the territory and is applied to the earth as an object; but at the same\n\ntime, the sign ceases to be inscribed upon the body and is written upon an\n\nimmobile, objective matter. For there to be work, there must be a capture\n\nof activity by the State apparatus, and a semiotization of activity by writ-\n\ning. Hence the affinity between the assemblages signs-tools, and signs of\n\nwriting-organization of work. Entirely different is the case of the weapon,\n\nwhich is in an essential relation with jewelry. Jewelry has undergone so\n\nmany secondary adaptations that we no longer have a clear understanding\n\nof what it is. But something lights up in our mind when we are told that\n\nmetalworking was the \"barbarian,\" or nomad, art par excellence, and when\n\nwe see these masterpieces of minor art. These fibulas, these gold or silver\n\nplaques, these pieces of jewelry, are attached to small movable objects; they\n\nare not only easy to transport, but pertain to the object only as object in\n\nmotion. These plaques constitute traits of expression of pure speed, car-\n\nried on objects that are themselves mobile and moving. The relation\n\nbetween them is not that of form-matter but of motif-support, where the\n\nearth is no longer anything more than ground _(sol), _where there is no longer\n\neven any ground at all because the support is as mobile as the motif. They\n\nlend colors the speed of light, turning gold to red and silver to white light.\n\nThey are attached to the horse's harness, the sheath of the sword, the\n\nwarrior's garments, the handle of the weapon; they even decorate things\n\nused only once, such as arrowheads. Regardless of the effort or toil they\n\nimply, they are of the order of free action, related to pure mobility, and not\n\nof the order of work with its conditions of gravity, resistance, and expendi-\n\nture. The ambulant smith links metalworking to the weapon, and vice\n\nversa. Gold and silver have taken on many other functions but cannot be\n\nunderstood apart from this nomadic contribution made by the war\n\nmachine, in which they are not matters but traits of expression appropriate\n\nto weapons (the whole mythology of war not only subsists in money but is\n\nthe active factor in it). Jewels are the affects corresponding to weapons,\nthat\n\nare swept up by the same speed vector.\n\nMetalworking, jewelry making, ornamentation, even decoration, do not\n\nform a writing, even though they have a power of abstraction that is in\n\nevery way equal to that of writing. But this power is assembled differently.\n\nIn the case of writing, the nomads had no need to create their own system;\n\nthey borrowed that of their sedentary imperial neighbors, who even fur-\n\nnished them with a phonetic transcription of their languages.\n\n81\n\n\"The\n\ngoldsmith's and silversmith's is the barbarian art par excellence; filigree\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)424.png)\n\n0\n\n402 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nand gold and silver plating. . . .

The point is\n\nthat in its early period runic writing had only a weak communication value\n\nand a very restricted public function. Its secret character has led many to\n\ninterpret it as magical writing. Rather, it is an affective semiotic, compris-\n\ning in particular: (1) signatures, as marks of possession or fabrication, and\n\n(2) short war or love messages. It constitutes a text that is \"ornamental\"\n\nrather than scriptural, \"an invention with little utility, half-aborted,\" a\nsub-\n\nstitute writing. It only takes on the value of writing during a second period,\n\nwhen monumental inscriptions appear, with the Danish reform of the\n\nninth century A.D., in connection with the State and work.\n\n83\n\nIt may be objected that tools, weapons, signs, and jewelry in fact occur\n\neverywhere, in a common sphere. But that is not the problem, any more\n\nthan it is to seek an origin in each case. It is a question of assigning\nassem-\n\nblages, in other words, of determining the _differential traits _according to\n\nwhich an element formally belongs to one assemblage rather than to\n\nanother. It could also be said that architecture and cooking have an appar-\n\nent affinity with the State, whereas music and drugs have differential traits\n\nthat place them on the side of the nomadic war machine.\n\n84\n\n_It is therefore a _\n\n_differential method that establishes the distinction between weapons and  \ntools, _from at least five points of view: the direction _(sens) _\n\n(projection-introception), the vector (speed-gravity), the model (free\n\naction-work), the expression (jewelry-signs), and the passional or desiring\n\ntonality (affect-feeling). Doubtless the State apparatus tends to bring\n\nuniformity to the regimes, by disciplining its armies, by making work a\n\nfundamental unit, in other words, by imposing its own traits.

History contests each\n\ninnovation but cannot succeed in effacing the nomad traces. What the\n\nnomads invented was the man-animal-weapon, man-horse-bow assem-\n\nblage. Through this assemblage of speed, the ages of metal are marked by\n\ninnovation. The socketed bronze battle-ax of the Hyksos and the iron\n\nsword of the Hittites have been compared to miniature atomic bombs. It\n\nhas been possible to establish a rather precise periodization of the weapons\n\nof the steppe, showing the alternation between heavy and light armament\n\n(the Scythian type and the Sarmatian type), and their mixed forms. The\n\ncast steel saber, often short and curved, a weapon for side attack with the\n\nedge of the blade, envelops a different dynamic space than the forged iron\n\nsword used for frontal attack with the point: it was the Scythians who\n\nbrought it to India and Persia, where the Arabs would later acquire it. It is\n\ncommonly agreed that the nomads lost their role as innovators with the\n\nadvent of firearms, in particular the cannon (\"gunpowder overtook\n\nthem\"). But it was not necessarily because they did not know how to use\n\nthem. Not only did armies like the Turkish army, whose nomadic tradi-\n\ntions remained strong, develop extensive firepower, a new space, but addi-\n\ntionally, and even more characteristically, light artillery was thoroughly\n\nintegrated into mobile formations of wagons, pirate ships, etc. If the can-\n\nnon marks a limit for the nomads, it is on the contrary because it implies an\n\neconomic investment that only a State apparatus can make (even commer-\n\ncial cities do not suffice). The fact remains that for weapons other than\nfire-\n\narms, and even for the cannon, there is always a nomad on the horizon of a\n\ngiven _technological lineage*_\n\n_6_\n\nObviously, each case is controversial, as demonstrated by the debates on\n\nthe stirrup.\n\n87\n\nThe problem is that it is generally difficult to distinguish\n\nbetween what comes from the nomads as such, and what they receive from\n\nthe empire they communicate with, conquer, or integrate with. There are\n\nso many gray areas, intermediaries, and combinations between an imper-\n\nial army and a nomad war machine that it is often the case that things origi-\n\nnate in the empire. The example of the saber is typical, and unlike the\n\nstirrup, there is no longer any doubt. Although it is true that the Scythians\n\nwere the propagators of the saber, introducing it to the Hindus, Persians,\n\nand Arabs, they were also its first victims, they started off on the receiving\n\nend; it was invented by the Chinese empire of the Ch'in and Han dynasties,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)427.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE D 405\n\nthe exclusive master of steel casting or crucible steel.\n\n88\n\nThis is a good exam-\n\nple to illustrate the difficulties facing modern archaeologists and his-\n\ntorians. Even archaeologists are not immune from a certain hatred or\n\ncontempt for the nomads. In the case of the saber, where the facts already\n\nspeak sufficiently in favor of an imperial origin, the best of the commenta-\n\ntors finds it fitting to add that the Scythians could not have invented it at\n\nany rate\u2014poor nomads that they were\u2014and that crucible steel necessarily\n\ncame from a sedentary milieu. But why follow the very old, official Chinese\n\nversion according to which deserters from the imperial army revealed the\n\nsecrets to the Scythians? And what can \"revealing the secret\" mean if the\n\nScythians were incapable of putting it to use, and understood nothing of all\n\nthat? Blame the deserters, why don't you. You don't make an atomic bomb\n\nwith a secret, any more than you make a saber if you are incapable of repro-\n\nducing it, and of integrating it under different conditions, of transferring\nit\n\nto other assemblages. Propagation and diffusion are fully a part of the line\n\nof innovation; they mark a bend in it. On top of that, why say that crucible\n\nsteel is necessarily the property of sedentaries or imperial subjects, when it\n\nis first of all the invention of metallurgists? It is assumed that these\nmetal-\n\nlurgists were necessarily controlled by a State apparatus; but they also had\n\nto enjoy a certain technological autonomy, and social clandestinity, so that,\n\neven controlled, they did not belong to the State any more than they were\n\nthemselves nomads. There were no deserters who betrayed the secret, but\n\nrather metallurgists who communicated it and made its adaptation and\n\npropagation possible: an entirely different kind of \"betrayal.\" In the last\n\nanalysis, what makes the discussions so difficult (both in the controversial\n\ncase of the stirrup and in the definite case of the saber) are not only the\nprej-\n\nudices about the nomads but also the absence of a sufficiently elaborated\n\nconcept of the technological lineage (what defines a _technological line or  \ncontinuum, _and its variable extension, from a given standpoint?).\n\nIt would be useless to say that metallurgy is a science because it discovers\n\nconstant laws, for example, the melting point of a metal at all times and in\n\nall places. For metallurgy is inseparable from several lines of variation:\nvar-\n\niation between meteorites and indigenous metals; variation between ores\n\nand proportions of metal; variation between alloys, natural and artificial;\n\nvariation between the operations performed upon a metal; variation\n\nbetween the qualities that make a given operation possible, or that result\n\nfrom a given operation (for example, twelve varieties of copper identified\n\nand inventoried at Sumer by place of origin and degree of refinement).\n\n89\n\nAll of these variables can be grouped under two overall rubrics: _singulari-  \nties or spatiotemporal haecceities _of different orders, and the operations\n\nassociated with them as processes of deformation or transformation;  \n_affective qualities or traits ofexpression _of different levels,\ncorresponding to\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)428.png)\n\n0\n\n406 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nthese singularities and operations (hardness, weight, color, etc.). Let us\n\nreturn to the example of the saber, or rather of crucible steel. It implies\nthe\n\nactualization of a first singularity, namely, the melting of the iron at high\n\ntemperature; then a second singularity, the successive decarbonations; cor-\n\nresponding to these singularities are traits of expression\u2014not only the\n\nhardness, sharpness, and finish, but also the undulations or designs traced\n\nby the crystallization and resulting from the internal structure of the cast\n\nsteel. The iron sword is associated with entirely different singularities\n\nbecause it is forged and not cast or molded, quenched and not air cooled,\n\nproduced by the piece and not in number; its traits of expression are neces-\n\nsarily very different because it pierces rather than hews, attacks from the\n\nfront rather than from the side; even the expressive designs are obtained in\n\nan entirely different way, by inlay.\n\n90\n\nWe may speak of a _machinic phylum, _or\n\ntechnological lineage, wherever we find _a constellation of singularities,  \nprolongable by certain operations, which converge, and make the operations  \nconverge, upon one or several assignable traits of expression. _If the\nsingulari-\n\nties or operations diverge, in different materials or in the same material, we\n\nmust distinguish two different phyla: this is precisely the case for the iron\n\nsword, descended from the dagger, and the steel saber, descended from the\n\nknife. Each phylum has its own singularities and operations, its own quali-\n\nties and traits, which determine the relation of desire to the technical ele-\n\nment (the affects the saber \"has\" are not the same as those of the sword).\n\nBut it is always possible to situate the analysis on the level of\nsingularities\n\nthat are prolongable from one phylum to another, and to tie the two phyla\n\ntogether. At the limit, there is a single phylogenetic lineage, a single\n\nmachinic phylum, ideally continuous: the flow of matter-movement, the\n\nflow of matter in continuous variation, conveying singularities and traits\n\nof expression. This operative and expressive flow is as much artificial as\n\nnatural: it is like the unity of human beings and Nature. But at the same\n\ntime, it is not realized in the here and now without dividing, differentiat-\n\ning. We will call an _assemblage _every constellation of singularities and\n\ntraits deducted from the flow\u2014selected, organized, stratified\u2014in such a\n\nway as to converge (consistency) artificially and naturally; an assemblage,\n\nin this sense, is a veritable invention. Assemblages may group themselves\n\ninto extremely vast constellations constituting \"cultures,\" or even \"ages\";\n\nwithin these constellations, the assemblages still differentiate the phyla or\n\nthe flow, dividing it into so many different phylas, of a given order, on a\n\ngiven level, and introducing selective discontinuities in the ideal continu-\n\nity of matter-movement. The assemblages cut the phylum up into distinct,\n\ndifferentiated lineages, at the same time as the machinic phylum cuts\n\nacross them all, taking leave of one to pick up again in another, or making\n\nthem coexist.

We may distin-\n\nguish in every case a number of very different lines. Some of them,\n\nphylogenetic lines, travel long distances between assemblages of various ages\n\nand cultures (from the blowgun to the cannon? from the prayer wheel to\n\nthe propeller? from the pot to the motor?); others, ontogenetic lines, are\n\ninternal to one assemblage and link up its various elements or else cause\n\none element to pass, often after a delay, into another assemblage of a differ-\n\nent nature but of the same culture or age (for example, the horseshoe, which\n\nspread through agricultural assemblages). It is thus necessary to take into\n\naccount the selective action of the assemblages upon the phylum, and the\n\nevolutionary reaction of the phylum as the subterranean thread that passes\n\nfrom one assemblage to another, or quits an assemblage, draws it forward\n\nand opens it up. _Vital impulse! _Leroi-Gourhan has gone the farthest\n\ntoward a technological vitalism taking biological evolution in general as\n\nthe model for technical evolution: a _Universal Tendency, _laden with all of\n\nthe singularities and traits of expression, traverses technical and interior\n\nmilieus that refract or differentiate it in accordance with the singularities\n\nand traits each of them retains, selects, draws together, causes to converge,\n\ninvents.\n\n91\n\nThere is indeed a machinic phylum in variation that creates the\n\ntechnical assemblages, whereas the assemblages invent the various phyla.\n\nA technological lineage changes significantly according to whether one\n\ndraws it upon the phylum or inscribes it in the assemblages; but the two are\n\ninseparable.\n\nSo how are we to define this matter-movement, this matter-energy, this\n\nmatter-flow, this matter in variation that enters assemblages and leaves\n\nthem? It is a destratified, deterritorialized matter. It seems to us that\n\nHusserl brought thought a decisive step forward when he discovered a\n\nregion of _vague and material _essences (in other words, essences that are\n\nvagabond, anexact and yet rigorous), distinguishing them from fixed,\n\nmetric and formal, essences. We have seen that these vague essences are as\n\ndistinct from formed things as they are from formal essences. They con-\n\nstitute fuzzy aggregates. They relate to a _corporeality _(materiality) that\nis\n\nnot to be confused either with an intelligible, formal essentiality or a sen-\n\nsible, formed and perceived, thinghood. This corporeality has two char-\n\nacteristics: on the one hand, it is inseparable from passages to the limit as\n\nchanges of state, from processes of deformation or transformation that oper-\n\nate in a space-time itself anexact and that act in the manner of events\n\n(ablation, adjunction, projection . . .); on the other hand, it is inseparable\n\nfrom expressive or intensive qualities, which can be higher or lower in\n\ndegree, and are produced in the manner of variable affects (resistance,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)430.png)\n\n0\n\n408 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nhardness, weight, color . . .)\u2022 There is thus an ambulant coupling,  \n_events-affects, _which constitutes the vague corporeal essence and is\ndistinct\n\nfrom the sedentary linkage, \"fixed essence-properties of the thing\n\nderiving from the essence,\" \"formal essence-formed thing.\" Doubtless\n\nHusserl had a tendency to make the vague essence a kind of intermediary\n\nbetween the essence and the sensible, between the thing and the concept, a\n\nlittle like the Kantian schema. Is not roundness a schematic or vague essence,\n\nintermediary between rounded sensible things and the conceptual essence of\n\nthe circle? In effect, roundness exists only as a threshold-affect (neither\nflat\n\nnor pointed) and as a limit-process (becoming rounded), through sensible\n\nthings and technical agents, millstone, lathe, wheel, spinning wheel socket,\n\netc. But it is only \"intermediary\" to the extent that what is intermediary is\n\nautonomous, initially stretching _itself _between things, and between\n\nthoughts, to establish a whole new relation between thoughts and things, a  \n_vague _identity between the two.\n\nCertain distinctions proposed by Simondon can be compared to those\n\nof Husserl. For Simondon exposes the technological insufficiency of the\n\nmatter-form model, in that it assumes a fixed form and a matter deemed\n\nhomogeneous. It is the idea of the law that assures the model's coherence,\n\nsince laws are what submit matter to this or that form, and conversely,\n\nrealize in matter a given property deduced from the form. But Simondon\n\ndemonstrates that the _hylomorphic _model leaves many things, active and\n\naffective, by the wayside. On the one hand, to the formed or formable mat-\n\nter we must add an entire energetic materiality in movement, carrying _sin-  \ngularities _or _haecceities _that are already like implicit forms that are\n\ntopological, rather than geometrical, and that combine with processes of\n\ndeformation: for example, the variable undulations and torsions of the\n\nfibers guiding the operation of splitting wood. On the other hand, to the\n\nessential properties of the matter deriving from the formal essence we must\n\nadd _variable intensive affects, _now resulting from the operation, now on the\n\ncontrary making it possible: for example, wood that is more or less porous,\n\nmore or less elastic and resistant. At any rate, it is a question of\nsurrender-\n\ning to the wood, then following where it leads by connecting operations to a\n\nmateriality, instead of imposing a form upon a matter: what one addresses\n\nis less a matter submitted to laws than a materiality possessing a _nomos. _\n\nOne addresses less a form capable of imposing properties upon a matter\n\nthan material traits of expression constituting affects. Of course, it is\n\nalways possible to \" translate\" into a model that which escapes the model;\n\nthus, one may link the materiality's power of variation to laws adapting a\n\nfixed form and a constant matter to one another. But this cannot be done\n\nwithout a distortion that consists in uprooting variables form the state of\n\ncontinuous variation, in order to extract from them fixed points and con-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)431.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 409\n\nstant relations. Thus one throws the variables off, even changing the nature\n\nof the equations, which cease to be immanent to matter-movement\n\n(inequations, adequations). The question is not whether such a translation\n\nis conceptually legitimate\u2014it is\u2014but what intuition gets lost in it. In\n\nshort, what Simondon criticizes the hylomorphic model for is taking form\n\nand matter to be two terms defined separately, like the ends of two\n\nhalf-chains whose connection can no longer be seen, like a simple\n\nrelation of molding behind which there is a perpetually variable,\n\ncontinuous modulation that it is no longer possible to grasp.\n\n92\n\nThe critique of\n\nthe hylomorphic schema is based on \"the existence, between form and\n\nmatter, of a zone of medium and intermediary dimension,\" of energetic,\n\nmolecular dimension\u2014a space unto itself that deploys its materiality\n\nthrough matter, a number unto itself that propels its traits through form.\n\nWe always get back to this definition: the _machinic phylum _is ma-\n\nteriality, natural or artificial, and both simultaneously; it is matter in\n\nmovement, in flux, in variation, matter as a conveyor of singularities and\n\ntraits of expression. This has obvious consequences: namely, this\n\nmatter-flow can only _he followed. _Doubtless, the operation that consists in\n\nfollowing can be carried out in one place: an artisan who planes follows the\n\nwood, the fibers of the wood, without changing location. But this way of\n\nfollowing is only one particular sequence in a more general process. For\n\nartisans are obliged to follow in another way as well, in other words, to go\n\nfind the wood where it lies, and to find the wood with the right kind of\n\nfibers. Otherwise, they must have it brought to them: it is only because\n\nmerchants take care of one segment of the journey in reverse that the\n\nartisans can avoid making the trip themselves. But artisans are complete\n\nonly if they are also prospectors; and the organization that separates\n\nprospectors, merchants, and artisans already mutilates artisans in order to\n\nmake \"workers\" of them. We will therefore define the artisan as one who\n\nis determined in such a way as to follow a flow of matter, a _machinic  \nphylum. _The artisan is _the itinerant, the ambulant. _To follow the flow of\n\nmatter is to itinerate, to ambulate. It is intuition in action. Of course,\nthere\n\nare second-order itinerancies where it is no longer a flow of matter that one\n\nprospects and follows, but, for example, a market. Nevertheless, it is\n\nalways a flow that is followed, even if the flow is not always that of\n\nmatter. And, above all, there are secondary itinerancies, which derive\n\nfrom another \"condition,\" even if they are necessarily entailed by it. For\n\nexample, a _transhumant, _whether a farmer or an animal raiser, changes\n\nland after it is worn out, or else seasonally; but transhumants only\n\nsecondarily follow a land flow, because they undertake a rotation meant\n\nfrom the start to return them to the point from which they left, after the\n\nforest has regenerated, the land has rested, the weather has changed.\n\nTranshumants do not follow a flow, they draw a circuit; they only\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)432.png)\n\n0\n\n410 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nfollow the part of the flow that enters into the circuit, even an ever-wid-\n\nening one. Transhumants are therefore itinerant only consequentially, or\n\nbecome itinerant only when their circuit of land or pasture has been\n\nexhausted, or when the rotation has become so wide that the flows escape\n\nthe circuit. Even the merchant is a transhumant, to the extent that mercan-\n\ntile flows are subordinated to the rotation between a point of departure and\n\na point of arrival (go get-bring back, import-export, buy-sell). Whatever\n\nthe reciprocal implications, there are considerable differences between a\n\nflow and a circuit. The _migrant, _we have seen, is something else again. And\n\nthe _nomad _is not primarily defined as an _itinerant _or as a _transhumant,\n_nor\n\nas a _migrant, _even though nomads become these consequentially. The pri-\n\nmary determination of nomads is to occupy and hold a smooth space: it is\n\nthis aspect that determines them as nomad (essence). On their own\n\naccount, they will be transhumants, or itinerants, only by virtue of the\n\nimperatives imposed by the smooth spaces. In short, whatever the de facto\n\nmixes between nomadism, itinerancy, and transhumance, the primary\n\nconcept is different in the three cases (smooth space, matter-flow, rota-\n\ntion). It is only on the basis of the distinct concept that we can make a\njudg-\n\nment on the mix\u2014on when it is produced, on the form in which it is\n\nproduced, and on the order in which it is produced.\n\nBut in the course of the preceding discussion, we have wandered from\n\nthe question: Why is the _machinic phylum, _the flow of matter, essentially\n\nmetallic or metallurgical? Here again, it is only the distinct concept that\n\ncan give us an answer, in that it shows that there is a special, primary rela-\n\ntion between itinerance and metallurgy (deterritorialization). However,\n\nthe examples we took from Husserl and Simondon concerned wood and\n\nclay as well as metals. Besides, are there not flows of grass, water, herds,\n\nwhich form so many phyla or matters in movement? It is easier for us to\n\nanswer these questions now. For it is as if metal and metallurgy imposed\n\nupon and raised to consciousness something that is only hidden or buried\n\nin the other matters and operations. The difference is that elsewhere the\n\noperations occur between two thresholds, one of which constitutes the\n\nmatter prepared for the operation, and the other the form to be incarnated\n\n(for example, the clay and the mold). The hylomorphic model derives its\n\ngeneral value from this, since the incarnated form that marks the end of an\n\noperation can serve as the matter for a new operation, but in a fixed order\n\nmarking a succession of thresholds. In metallurgy, on the other hand, the\n\noperations are always astride the thresholds, so that an energetic\n\nmateriality overspills the prepared matter, and a qualitative deformation\n\nor transformation overspills the form.\n\n93\n\nFor example, quenching follows\n\nforging and takes place after the form has been fixed. Or, to take another\n\nexample, in molding, the metallurgist in a sense works inside the mold. Or\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)433.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE D 411\n\nagain, steel that is melted and molded later undergoes a series of successive\n\ndecarbonations. Finally, metallurgy has the option of melting down and\n\nreusing a matter to which it gives an _ingot-form: _the history of metal is\n\ninseparable from this very particular form, which is not to be confused\n\nwith either a stock or a commodity; monetary value derives from it. More\n\ngenerally, the metallurgical idea of the \"reducer\" expresses this double lib-\n\neration of a materiality in relation to a prepared matter, and of a transfor-\n\nmation in relation to the form to be incarnated. Matter and form have\n\nnever seemed more rigid than in metallurgy; yet the succession of forms\n\ntends to be replaced by the form of a continuous development, and the var-\n\niability of matters tends to be replaced by the matter of a continuous varia-\n\ntion. If metallurgy has an essential relation with music, it is by virtue not\n\nonly of the sounds of the forge but also of the tendency within both arts to\n\nbring into its own, beyond separate forms, a continuous development of\n\nform, and beyond variable matters, a continuous variation of matter: a\n\nwidened chromaticism sustains both music and metallurgy; the musical\n\nsmith was the first \"transformer.\"\n\n94\n\nIn short, what metal and metallurgy\n\nbring to light is a life proper to matter, a vital state of matter as such, a\nmate-\n\nrial vitalism that doubtless exists everywhere but is ordinarily hidden or\n\ncovered, rendered unrecognizable, dissociated by the hylomorphic model.\n\nMetallurgy is the consciousness or thought of the matter-flow, and metal\n\nthe correlate of this consciousness. As expressed in panmetallism, metal is\n\ncoextensive to the whole of matter, and the whole of matter to metallurgy.\n\nEven the waters, the grasses and varieties of wood, the animals are popu-\n\nlated by salts or mineral elements. Not everything is metal, but metal is\n\neverywhere. Metal is the conductor of all matter. The machinic phylum is\n\nmetallurgical, or at least has a metallic head, as its itinerant probe-head or\n\nguidance device. And thought is born more from metal than from stone:\n\nmetallurgy is minor science in person, \"vague\" science or the phenom-\n\nenology of matter. The prodigious idea _of Nonorganic Life_\u2014the very same\n\nidea Worringer considered the barbarian idea par excellence\n\n95\n\n\u2014was the\n\ninvention, the intuition of metallurgy. Metal is neither a thing nor an\n\norganism, but a _body _without organs. The \"Northern, or Gothic, line\" is\n\nabove all a mining or metallic line delimiting this body. The relation\n\nbetween metallurgy and alchemy reposes not, as Jung believed, on the sym-\n\nbolic value of metal and its correspondence with an organic soul but on the\n\nimmanent power of corporeality in all matter, and on the esprit de corps\n\naccompanying it.\n\nThe first and primary itinerant is the artisan. But artisans are neither\n\nhunters, farmers, nor animal raisers. Neither are they winnowers or pot-\n\nters, who only secondarily take up craft activity. Rather, artisans are those\n\nwho follow the matter-flow as pure productivity: therefore in mineral\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)434.png)\n\n412 O 1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nform, and not in vegetable or animal form. They are not of the land, or of\n\nthe soil, but of the subsoil. Because metal is the pure productivity of\nmatter,\n\nthose who follow metal are producers of objects par excellence. As demon-\n\nstrated by V. Gordon Childe, the metallurgist is the first specialized arti-\n\nsan, and in this respect forms a collective _body _(secret societies, guilds,\n\njourneymen's associations). Artisans-metallurgists are itinerants because\n\nthey follow the matter-flow of the subsoil. Of course metallurgists have\n\nrelations with \"the others,\" those of the soil, land, and sky. They have rela-\n\ntions with the farmers of the sedentary communities, and with the celestial\n\nfunctionaries of the empire who overcode those communities; in fact, they\n\nneed them to survive, they depend on an imperial agricultural stockpile for\n\ntheir very sustenance.\n\n96\n\nBut in their work, they have relations with the forest\n\ndwellers, and partially depend on them: they must establish their workshops\n\nnear the forest in order to obtain the necessary charcoal. In their space,\n\nthey have relations with the nomads, since the subsoil unites the ground  \n_(sol) _of smooth space and the land of striated space: there are no mines in\n\nthe alluvial valleys of the empire-dominated farmers; it is necessary to\n\ncross deserts, approach the mountains; and the question of control over\n\nthe mines always involves nomadic peoples. _Every mine is a line of flight _\n\nthat is in communication with smooth spaces\u2014there are parallels today in\n\nthe problems with oil.\n\nArchaeology and history remain strangely silent on this question of the\n\ncontrol over the mines. There have been empires with a strong metallurgi-\n\ncal organization that had no mines; the Near East lacked tin, so necessary\n\nfor the fabrication of bronze. Large quantities of metal arrived in ingot\n\nform, and from very far away (for instance, tin from Spain or even from\n\nCornwall). So complex a situation implies not only a strong imperial\n\nbureaucracy and elaborate long-distance commercial circuits; it also\n\nimplies a shifting politics, in which States confront an outside, in which\n\nvery different peoples confront one another, or else reach some accommo-\n\ndation on particular aspects of the control of mines (extraction, charcoal,\n\nworkshops, transportation). It is not enough to say that there are wars and\n\nmining expeditions; or to invoke \"a Eurasian synthesis of the nomadic\n\nworkshops from the approaches of China to the tip of Britanny,\" and\n\nremark that \"the nomadic populations had been in contact with the princi-\n\npal metallurgical centers of the ancient world since prehistoric times.\"\n\n97\n\nWhat is needed is a better knowledge of the nomads' relations with these\n\ncenters, with the smiths they themselves employed or frequented, with\n\nproperly metallurgical peoples or groups who were their neighbors.

The study of myths, and even eth-  \nnographic considerations on the status of smiths, divert us from these  \npolitical questions. Mythology and ethnology do not have the right method  \nin this regard. It is too often asked how _the others _\"react\" to the smith,\nand  \nas a result, one succumbs to the usual platitudes about the ambivalence of  \n_feelings; _it is said that the smith is simultaneously honored, feared, and  \nscorned\u2014more or less scorned among the nomads, more or less honored  \namong the sedentaries.\n\n98\n\nBut this loses sight of the reasons for this situa-\n\ntion, of the specificity of the smiths themselves, of the nonsymmetrical  \nrelation they entertain with the nomads and the sedentaries, the type of  \n_affects _they invent (metallic affect). Before looking at the feelings of\nothers  \ntoward smiths, it is necessary to evaluate the smiths themselves as Other;  \nas such, they have different affective relations with the sedentaries and the  \nnomads.\n\nThere are no nomadic or sedentary smiths. Smiths are ambulant, itiner-\n\nant. Particularly important in this respect is the way in which smiths live:  \ntheir space is neither the striated space of the sedentary nor the smooth  \nspace of the nomad. Smiths may have a tent, they may have a house; they  \ninhabit them in the manner of an \"ore bed\" (gite, shelter, home, mineral  \ndeposit), like metal itself, in the manner of a cave or a hole, a hut half or\nall  \nunderground. They are cave dwellers not by nature but by artistry and  \nneed.\" A splendid text by Elie Faure evokes the infernal progress of the  \nitinerant peoples of India as they bore holes in space and create the fantas-  \ntic forms corresponding to these breakthroughs, the vital forms of  \nnonorganic life: \"There at the shore of the sea, at the base of a mountain,  \nthey encountered a great wall of granite. Then they all entered the granite;  \nin its shadows they lived, loved, worked, died, were born, and, three or four  \ncenturies afterward, they came out again, leagues away, having traversed  \nthe mountain.

They are\n\nin themselves double: a hybrid, an alloy, a twin formation. As Griaule says,\n\nDogon smiths are not \"impure\" but \"mixed,\" and it is because they are\n\nmixed that they are _endogamous, _that they do not intermarry with the\n\npure, who have a simplified progeny while they reconstitute a twin prog-\n\neny.\n\n102\n\nChilde demonstrates that metallurgists are necessarily doubled,\n\nthat they exist two times, once as captured by and maintained within the\n\napparatus of the oriental empire, again in the Aegean world, where they\n\nwere much more mobile and much freer. _But the two segments cannot be  \nseparated, _simply by relating each of them to their particular context. The\n\nmetallurgist belonging to an empire, the worker, presupposes a metallur-\n\ngist-prospector, however far away; and the prospector ties in with a mer-\n\nchant, who brings the metal to the first metallurgist. In addition, the metal\n\nis worked on by each segment, and the ingot-form is common to them all:\n\nwe must imagine less separate segments than a chain of mobile workshops\n\nconstituting, from hole to hole, a line of variation, a gallery. Thus the met-\n\nallurgists' relation to the nomads and the sedentaries also passes through\n\nthe relations they have with other metallurgists.\n\n103\n\nThis hybrid metallur-\n\ngist, a weapon- and toolmaker, communicates with the sedentaries _and _\n\nwith the nomads at the same time. Holey space itself communicates with\n\nsmooth space and striated space. In effect, the machinic phylum or the\n\nmetallic line passes through all of the assemblages: nothing is more\n\ndeterritorialized than matter-movement. But it is not at all in the same\n\nway, and the two communications are not symmetrical. Worringer, in the\n\ndomain of aesthetics, said that the abstract line took on two quite different\n\nexpressions, one in barbarian Gothic art, the other in the organic classical\n\nart. Here, we would say that the phylum simultaneously has two different\n\nmodes of liaison: it is always _connected _to nomad space, whereas it _conju-  \ngates _with sedentary space. On the side of the nomadic assemblages and\n\nwar machines, it is a kind of rhizome, with its gaps, detours, subterranean\n\npassages, stems, openings, traits, holes, etc. On the other side, the seden-\n\ntary assemblages and State apparatuses effect a capture of the phylum, put\n\nthe traits of expression into a form or a code, make the holes resonate\n\ntogether, plug the lines of flight, subordinate the technological operation to\n\nthe work model, impose upon the connections a whole regime of arbor-\n\nescent conjunctions.\n\nA\n\nXIOM\n\nIII. _The nomad war machine is the form of expression, of which _\n\n_itinerant metallurgy is the correlative form of content._\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)438.png)\n\n0\n\n416 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nContent\n\nExpression\n\nSubstance\n\nHoley space\n\n(machinic phylum\n\nor matter-flow)\n\nSmooth space\n\nForm\n\nItinerant\n\nmetallurgy\n\nNomad war\n\nmachine\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nIX. _War does not necessarily have the battle as its object, _\n\n_and more important, the war machine does not necessarily have war as  \nits object, although war and the battle may be its necessary result  \n(under certain conditions)._\n\nWe now come to three successive problems. First, is the battle the\n\n\"object\" of war? But also, is war the \"object\" of the war machine? And\n\nfinally, to what extent is the war machine the \"object\" of the State appara-\n\ntus? The ambiguity of the first two problems is certainly due to the term\n\n\"object,\" but implies their dependency on the third. We must nevertheless\n\napproach these problems gradually, even if we are reduced to multiplying\n\nexamples. The first question, that of the battle, requires an immediate dis-\n\ntinction to be made between two cases: when a battle is sought, and when it\n\nis essentially avoided by the war machine. These two cases in no way coin-\n\ncide with the offensive and the defensive. But war in the strict sense\n\n(according to a conception of it that culminated in Foch) does seem to have\n\nthe battle as its object, whereas guerrilla warfare explicitly aims for the  \n_nonbattle. _However, the development of war into the war of movement,\n\nand into total war, also places the notion of the battle in question, as much\n\nfrom the offensive as the defensive points of view: the concept of the\n\nnonbattle seems capable of expressing the speed of a flash attack, and the\n\ncounterspeed of an immediate response.\n\n104\n\nConversely, the development\n\nof guerilla warfare implies a moment when, and forms under which, a bat-\n\ntle must be effectively sought, in connection with exterior and interior\n\n\"support points.\" And it is true that guerrilla warfare and war proper are\n\nconstantly borrowing each other's methods and that the borrowings run\n\nequally in both directions (for example, stress has often been laid on the\n\ninspirations land-based guerrilla warfare received from maritime war). All\n\nwe can say is that the battle and the nonbattle are the double object of war,\n\naccording to a criterion that does not coincide with the offensive and the\n\ndefensive, or even with war proper and guerrilla warfare.\n\nThat is why we push the question further back, asking if war itself is the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)439.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE D 417\n\nobject of the war machine. It is not at all obvious. To the extent that war\n\n(with or without the battle) aims for the annihilation or capitulation of\n\nenemy forces, the war machine does not necessarily have war as its object\n\n(for example, the _raid can _be seen as another object, rather than as a\npartic-\n\nular form of war). But more generally, we have seen that the war machine\n\nwas the invention of the nomad, because it is in its essence the constitutive\n\nelement of smooth space, the occupation of this space, displacement\n\nwithin this space, and the corresponding composition of people: this is its\n\nsole and veritable positive object _(nomos). _Make the desert, the steppe,\n\ngrow; do not depopulate it, quite the contrary. If war necessarily results, it\n\nis because the war machine collides with States and cities, as forces (of\n\nstri-ation) opposing its positive object: from then on, the war machine has as\n\nits enemy the State, the city, the state and urban phenomenon, and adopts\n\nas its objective their annihilation. It is at this point that the war machine\n\nbecomes war: annihilate the forces of the State, destroy the State-form. The\n\nAttila, or Genghis Khan, adventure clearly illustrates this progression\n\nfrom the positive object to the negative object. Speaking like Aristotle, we\n\nwould say that war is neither the condition nor the object of the war\n\nmachine, but necessarily accompanies or completes it; speaking like\n\nDerrida, we would say that war is the \"supplement\" of the war machine. It\n\nmay even happen that this supplementarity is comprehended through a\n\nprogressive, anxiety-ridden revelation. Such, for example, was the adven-\n\nture of Moses: leaving the Egyptian State behind, launching into the desert,\n\nhe begins by forming a war machine, on the inspiration of the old past of\n\nthe nomadic Hebrews and on the advice of his father-in-law, who came\n\nfrom the nomads. This is the machine of the Just, already a war machine,\n\nbut one that does not yet have war as its object. Moses realizes, little by\nlit-\n\ntle, in stages, that war is the necessary supplement of that machine, because\n\nit encounters or must cross cities and States, because it must send ahead\n\nspies _(armed observation), _then perhaps take things to extremes _(war of  \nannihilation). _Then the Jewish people experience doubt, and fear that they\n\nare not strong enough; but Moses also doubts, he shrinks before the revela-\n\ntion of this supplement. And it will be Joshua, not Moses, who is charged\n\nwith waging war. Finally, speaking like Kant, we would say that the relation\n\nbetween war and the war machine is necessary but \"synthetic\" (Yahweh is\n\nnecessary for the synthesis).\n\nThe question of war, in turn, is pushed further back and is subordinated\n\nto the relations between the war machine and the State apparatus. States\n\nwere not the first to make war: war, of course, is not a phenomenon one\n\nfinds in the universality of Nature, as nonspecific violence. But war is not\n\nthe object of States, quite the contrary. The most archaic States do not even\n\nseem to have had a war machine, and their domination, as we will see, was\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)440.png)\n\n0\n\n418\n\n\u25a11227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nbased on other agencies (comprising, rather, the police and prisons). It is\n\nsafe to assume that the intervention of an extrinsic or nomad war machine\n\nthat counterattacked and destroyed the archaic but powerful States was\n\none of the mysterious reasons for their sudden annihilation. But the State\n\nlearns fast. One of the biggest questions from the point of view of universal\n\nhistory is: How will the State _appropriate _the war machine, that is, consti-\n\ntute one for itself, in conformity with its size, its domination, and its\naims?\n\nAnd with what risks? (What we call a military institution, or army, is not at\n\nall the war machine in itself, but the form under which it is appropriated by\n\nthe State.) In order to grasp the paradoxical character of such an undertak-\n\ning, we must recapitulate the hypothesis in its entirety. (1) The war\n\nmachine is that nomad invention that in fact has war not as its primary\n\nobject but as its second-order, supplementary or synthetic objective, in the\n\nsense that it is determined in such a way as to destroy the State-form and\n\ncity-form with which it collides. (2) When the State appropriates the war\n\nmachine, the latter obviously changes in nature and function, since it is\n\nafterward directed against the nomad and all State destroyers, or else\n\nexpresses relations between States, to the extent that a State undertakes\n\nexclusively to destroy another State or impose its aims upon it. (3) It is\npre-\n\ncisely after the war machine has been appropriated by the State in this way\n\nthat it tends to take war for its direct and primary object, for its\n\"analytic\"\n\nobject (and that war tends to take the battle for its object). In short, it is\nat\n\none and the same time that the State apparatus appropriates a war\n\nmachine, that the war machine takes war as its object, and that war be-\n\ncomes subordinated to the aims of the State.\n\nThis question of appropriation is so varied historically that it is neces-\n\nsary to distinguish between several kinds of problems. The first concerns\n\nthe possibility of the operation: it is precisely because war is only the sup-\n\nplementary or synthetic object of the nomad war machine that it experi-\n\nences the hesitation that proves fatal to it, and that the State apparatus for\n\nits part is able to lay hold of war and thus turn the war machine back against\n\nthe nomads. The hesitation of the nomad is legendary: What is to be done\n\nwith the lands conquered and crossed? Return them to the desert, to the\n\nsteppe, to open pastureland? Or let a State apparatus survive that is capa-\n\nble of exploiting them directly, at the risk of becoming, sooner or later,\nsim-\n\nply a new dynasty of that apparatus: sooner or later because Genghis Khan\n\nand his followers were able to hold out for a long time by partially integrat-\n\ning themselves into the conquered empires, while at the same time main-\n\ntaining a smooth space on the steppes to which the imperial centers were\n\nsubordinated. That was their genius, the _Pax Mongolica. _It remains the\n\ncase that the integration of the nomads into the conquered empires was one\n\nof the most powerful factors of appropriation of the war machine by the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)441.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 419\n\nState apparatus: the inevitable danger to which the nomads succumbed.\n\nBut there is another danger as well, the one threatening the State when it\n\nappropriates the war machine (all States have felt the weight of this danger,\n\nas well as the risks this appropriation represents for them). Tamerlane is\n\nthe extreme example. He was not Genghis Khan's successor but his exact\n\nopposite: it was Tamerlane who constructed a fantastic war machine\n\nturned back against the nomads, but who, by that very fact, was obliged to\n\nerect a State apparatus all the heavier and more unproductive since it\n\nexisted only as the empty form of appropriation of that machine.\n\n105\n\nTurn-\n\ning the war machine back against the nomads may constitute for the State a\n\ndanger as great as that presented by nomads directing the war machine\n\nagainst States.\n\nA second type of problem concerns the concrete forms the appropria-\n\ntion of the war machine takes: Mercenary or territorial? A professional\n\narmy or a conscripted army? A special body or national recruiting? Not\n\nonly are these formulas not equivalent, but there are all the possible mixes\n\nbetween them. Perhaps the most relevant distinction to make, or the most\n\ngeneral one, would be: Is there merely \"encastment\" of the war machine,\n\nor \"appropriation\" proper? The capture of the war machine by the State\n\napparatus took place following two paths, by encasting a society of warri-\n\nors (who arrived from without or arose from within), or on the contrary\n\nby constituting it in accordance with rules corresponding to civil society\n\nas a whole. Once again, there is passage and transition from one formula\n\nto another. Last, the third type of problem concerns the means of appro-\n\npriation. We must consider from this standpoint the various data pertain-\n\ning to the fundamental aspects of the State apparatus: _territoriality, work  \nor public works, taxation. _The constitution of a military institution or an\n\narmy necessarily implies a territorialization of the war machine, in other\n\nwords, the granting of land (\"colonial\" or domestic), which can take very\n\ndiverse forms. But at the same time, fiscal regimes determine both the\n\nnature of the services and taxes owed by the beneficiary warriors, and\n\nespecially the kind of civil tax to which all or part of society is subject\nfor\n\nthe maintenance of the army. And the State enterprise of public works\n\nmust be reorganized along the lines of a \"laying out of the territory\" in\n\nwhich the army plays a determining role, not only in the case of fortresses\n\nand fortified cities, but also in strategic communication, the logistical\n\nstructure, the industrial infrastructure, etc. (the role and function of the\n\nEngineer in this form of appropriation).\n\n106\n\nLet us compare this hypothesis as a whole with Clausewitz's formula:\n\n\"War is the continuation of politics by other means.\" As we know, this for-\n\nmula is itself extracted from a theoretical and practical, historic and\n\ntranshistoric, aggregate whose parts are interconnected. (1) There is a pure\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)442.png)\n\n0\n\n420 \u25a1\n\n1227: TREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE\n\nconcept of war as absolute, unconditioned war, an Idea not given in experi-\n\nence (bring down or \"upset\" the enemy, who is assumed to have no other\n\ndetermination, with no political, economic, or social considerations\n\nentering in). (2) What is given are real wars as submitted to State aims;\n\nStates are better or worse \"conductors\" in relation to absolute war, and in\n\nany case condition its realization in experience. (3) Real wars swing\n\nbetween two poles, both subject to State politics: the war of annihilation,\n\nwhich can escalate to total war (depending on the objectives of the annihi-\n\nlation) and tends to approach the unconditioned concept via an ascent to\n\nextremes; and limited war, which is no \"less\" a war, but one that effects a\n\ndescent toward limiting conditions, and can de-escalate to mere \"armed\n\nobservation.\"\n\n107\n\nIn the first place, the distinction between absolute war as Idea and real\n\nwars seems to us to be of great importance, but only if a different criterion\n\nthan that of Clausewitz is applied. The pure Idea is not that of the abstract\n\nelimination of the adversary but that of a war machine _that does not have  \nwar as its object _and that only entertains a potential or supplementary syn-\n\nthetic relation with war. Thus the nomad war machine does not appear to\n\nus to be one case of real war among others, as in Clausewitz, but on the con-\n\ntrary the content adequate to the Idea, the invention of the Idea, with its\n\nown objects, space, and composition of the _nomos. _Nevertheless it is still\n\nan Idea, and it is necessary to retain the concept of the pure Idea, even\n\nthough this war machine was realized by the nomads. It is the nomads,\n\nrather, who remain an abstraction, an Idea, something real and nonactual,\n\nand for several reasons: first, because the elements of nomadism, as we\n\nhave seen, enter into de facto mixes with elements of migration, itinerancy,\n\nand transhumance; this does not affect the purity of the concept, but intro-\n\nduces always mixed objects, or combinations of space and composition,\n\nwhich react back upon the war machine from the beginning. Second, even\n\nin the purity of its concept, the nomad war machine necessarily effectuates\n\nits synthetic relation with war as supplement, uncovered and developed in\n\nopposition to the State-form, the destruction of which is at issue. But that\nis\n\nexactly it; it does not effectuate this supplementary object or this synthetic\n\nrelation without the State, for its part, finding the opportunity to appropri-\n\nate the war machine, and the means of making war the direct object of this\n\nturned-around machine (thus the integration of the nomad into the State is\n\na vector traversing nomadism from the very beginning, from the first act of\n\nwar against the State).\n\nThe question is therefore less the realization of war than the appropria-\n\ntion of the war machine. It is at the same time that the State apparatus  \n_appropriates _the war machine, subordinates it to its \"political\" _aims, _and\n\ngives it war as its direct _object. _And it is one and the same historical\nten-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)443.png)\n\n0\n\n1227:\n\nTREATISE ON NOMADOLOGY\u2014THE WAR MACHINE \u25a1 421\n\ndency that causes State to evolve from a triple point of view: going from fig-\n\nures of encastment to forms of appropriation proper, going from limited\n\nwar to so-called total war, and transforming the relation between aim and\n\nobject. The factors that make State war total war are closely connected to\n\ncapitalism: it has to do with the investment of constant capital in equip-\n\nment, industry, and the war economy, and the investment of variable capi-\n\ntal in the population in its physical and mental aspects (both as warmaker\n\nand as victim of war).\n\n108\n\nTotal war is not only a war of annihilation but\n\narises when annihilation takes as its \"center\" not only the enemy army, or\n\nthe enemy State, but the entire population and its economy. The fact that\n\nthis double investment can be made only under prior conditions of limited\n\nwar illustrates the irresistible character of the capitalist tendency to\n\ndevelop total war.'\n\n09\n\nIt is therefore true that total war remains subordinated\n\nto State political aims and merely realizes the _maximal conditions _of the\n\nappropriation of the war machine by the State apparatus. But it is also true\n\nthat when total war becomes the object of the appropriated war machine,\n\nthen at this level in the set of all possible conditions, the object and the\naim\n\nenter into new relations that can reach the point of contradiction. This\n\nexplains Clausewitz's vacillation when he asserts at one point that total war\n\nremains a war conditioned by the political aim of States, and at another\n\nthat it tends to effectuate the Idea of unconditioned war. In effect, the aim\n\nremains essentially political and determined as such by the State, but the\n\nobject itself has become unlimited. We could say that the appropriation\n\nhas changed direction, or rather that States tend to unleash, reconstitute,\n\nan immense war machine of which they are no longer anything more than\n\nthe opposable or apposed parts. This worldwide war machine, which in a\n\nway \"reissues\" from the States, displays two successive figures: first, that\nof\n\nfascism, which makes war an unlimited movement with no other aim than\n\nitself; but fascism is only a rough sketch, and the second, postfascist,\nfigure\n\nis that of a war machine that takes peace as its obj ect directly, as the\npeace of\n\nTerror or Survival. The war machine reforms a smooth space that now\n\nclaims to control, to surround the entire earth. Total war itself is\nsurpassed,\n\ntoward a form of peace more terrifying still.

The State apparatus is thus animated by a curious  \nrhythm, which is first of all a great mystery: that of the Binder-Gods or  \nmagic emperors, _One-Eyed men _emitting from their single eye signs that  \ncapture, tie knots at a distance. The jurist-kings, on the other hand, are  \n_One-Armed _men who raise their single arm as an element of right and  \ntechnology, the law and the tool. In the succession of men of State, look  \nalways for the One-Eyed and the One-Armed, Horatius Codes and  \nMucius Scaevola (de Gaulle and\n\n424\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)447.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 425\n\nPompidou?). This is not to say that one has exclusive right to signs, the\n\nother to tools. The fearsome emperor is already the master of large-scale\n\nworks; the wise king takes up and transforms the entire regime of signs.\n\nWhat it means is that the combination, signs-tools, constitutes the differ-\n\nential trait of political sovereignty, or the complementarity of the State.\n\n2\n\n2\\. Of course, the two men of State are always getting mixed up in affairs of\n\nwar. But either the magic emperor sends to battle warriors who are not his\n\nown, whom he takes into his service by capture; or, more important,\n\nwhen he makes his appearance on the battlefield, he suspends the use of\n\nweapons, he throws his net over the warriors, his single eye throws them\n\ninto petrified catatonia, \"he binds without combat,\" he _encasts _the war\n\nmachine (this State capture is not to be confused with the captures of war:\n\nconquests, prisoners, spoils).\n\n3\n\nAs for the other pole, the jurist-king is a great\n\norganizer of war; but he gives it laws, lays out a field for it, makes it\nprinci-\n\npled, imposes a discipline upon it, subordinates it to political ends. He\n\nturns the war machine into a military institution, he _appropriates _the war\n\nmachine for the State apparatus.\n\n4\n\nWe should not be too hasty in speaking of\n\na softening, a humanization: on the contrary, this is perhaps when the war\n\nmachine has only one remaining object, that of war itself. Violence is found\n\neverywhere, but under different regimes and economies. The violence of\n\nthe magic emperor: his knot, his net, his way of \"making his moves once\n\nand for all\" ... The violence of the jurist-king: his way of beginning over\n\nagain every move, always with attention to ends, alliances, and laws... All\n\nthings considered, the violence of the war machine might appear softer and\n\nmore supple than that of the State apparatus because it does not yet have\n\nwar as its \"object,\" because it eludes both poles of the State. That is why\nthe\n\nman of war, in his exteriority, is always protesting the alliances and pacts\nof\n\nthe jurist-king, as well as severing the bonds of the magic emperor. He is\n\nequally an unbinder and a betrayer: twice the traitor.\n\n5\n\nHe has another econ-\n\nomy, another cruelty, but also another justice, another pity. To the signs\n\nand tools of the State, the man of war opposes his weapons and jewelry.\n\nOnce again, who could say which is better and which is worse? It is true that\n\nwar kills, and hideously mutilates. But it is especially true after the State\n\nhas appropriated the war machine. Above all, the State apparatus makes\n\nthe mutilation, and even death, come first. It needs them\n\npreaccom-plished, for people to be born that way, crippled and zombielike.\n\nThe myth of the zombie, of the living dead, is a work myth and not a war\n\nmyth. Mutilation is a consequence of war, but it is a necessary condition, a\n\npresupposition of the State apparatus and the organization of work (hence\n\nthe native infirmity not only of the worker but also of the man of State\n\nhimself, whether of the One-Eyed or the One-Armed type): \"The brutal\n\nexhibition of severed flesh shocked me....

Mythology reserved mutilation for\n\nmonsters, for human beasts of the race of Tantalus or Procrustes.... It is an\n\noptical illusion to attribute these mutilations to accidents. Actually, acci-\n\ndents are the result of mutilations that took place long ago in the embryo of\n\nour world; and the increase in amputations is one of the symptoms bearing\n\nwitness to the triumph of the morality of the scalpel. The loss occurred long\n\nbefore it was visibly taken into account.\"\n\n6\n\nThe State apparatus needs, at its\n\nsummit as at its base, predisabled people, preexisting amputees, the still-\n\nborn, the congenitally infirm, the one-eyed and one-armed.\n\nThus there is a tempting three-part hypothesis: the war machine is\n\n\"between\" the two poles of political sovereignty and assures the passage\n\nfrom one pole to the other. It is indeed in that order, 1-2-3, that things\nseem\n\nto present themselves in myth and history. Take two versions of the\n\nOne-Eyed and the One-Armed gods analyzed by Dumezil: (1) the god Odin,\n\nwho has a single eye, ties up the wolf of war and holds him in his magic\n\nbond; (2) but the wolf is wary and has at its disposal all its power of\n\nexteriority; (3) the god Tyr gives the wolf a legal security by leaving one of\n\nhis hands in the wolfs mouth so the wolf can bite it off if it does not\n\nsucceed in extricating itself from the bond. (1) Horatius Codes, the\n\nOne-Eyed, using only his face, his grimace and magic power, prevents\n\nthe Etruscan commander from attacking Rome; (2) the war commander\n\nthen decides to lay siege; (3) Mucius Scaevola takes a political tack,\n\noffering his hand as a security in order _to _persuade the warrior that it\n\nwould be best to abandon the siege and conclude a pact.\n\nIn an entirely different, historical, context, Marcel Detienne suggests an\n\nanalogous schema in three moments for ancient Greece: (1) The magic sov-\n\nereign, the \"Master of Truth,\" has at his disposal a war machine that doubt-\n\nless does not originate with him, and which enjoys a relative autonomy\n\nwithin his empire; (2) this class of warriors has its own rules, defined by\n\n\"isonomy,\" an isotropic space, and a \"milieu\" (war spoils are in the middle  \n_[au milieu], _he who speaks places himself in the middle of the assembly);\n\nthis is another space, the rules are different from those of the sovereign,\n\nwho captures and speaks from on high; (3) the hoplite reform, the ground-\n\nwork for which was laid in the warrior class, spread throughout the social\n\nbody, promoting the formation of an army of citizen-soldiers; at the same\n\ntime, the last vestiges of the imperial pole of sovereignty were replaced by\n\nthe juridical pole of the city-state (with isonomy as its law, and isotropy as\n\nits space).\n\n7\n\nThus in every case, the war machine seems to intervene\n\n\"between\" the two poles of the State apparatus, assuring and necessitating\n\nthe passage from one to the other.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)449.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 427\n\nWe cannot, however, assign this schema a causal meaning (the authors\n\ncited do not do so). In the first place, the war machine explains nothing; for\n\nit is either exterior to the State, and directed against it; or else it\nalready\n\nbelongs to the State, encasted and appropriated, and presupposes it. If the\n\nwar machine has a part in the evolution of the State, it is therefore\nnecessar-\n\nily in conjunction with other internal factors. And this is the second point:\n\nif there is an evolution of the State, the second pole, the evolved pole, must\n\nbe in resonance with the first, it must continually recharge it in some way,\n\nand the State must have only one milieu of interiority; in other words, it\n\nmust have a _unity of composition, _in spite of all the differences in\norganiza-\n\ntion and development among States. It is even necessary for each State to\n\nhave both poles, as the essential moments of its existence, even though the\n\norganization of the two varies. Third, if we call this interior essence or\nthis\n\nunity of the State \"capture,\" we must say that the words \"magic capture\"\n\ndescribe the situation well because it always appears as preaccomplished\n\nand self-presupposing; but how is this capture to be explained then, if it\n\nleads back to no _distinct _assignable cause? That is why theses on the origin\n\nof the State are always tautological. At times, exogenous factors, tied to war\n\nand the war machine, are invoked; at times endogenous factors, thought to\n\nengender private property, money, etc.; and at times specific factors,\n\nthought to determine the formation of \"public functions.\" All three of\n\nthese theses are found in Engels, in relation to a conception of the diversity\n\nof the roads to Domination. But they beg the question. War produces the\n\nState only if at least one of the two parts is a preexistent State; and the\n\norganization of war is a State factor only if that organization is a part of\nthe\n\nState. Either the State has no war machine (and has policemen and jailers\n\nbefore having soldiers), or else it has one, but in the form of a military\ninsti-\n\ntution or public function.\n\n8\n\nSimilarly, private property presupposes State\n\npublic property, it slips through its net; and money presupposes taxation. It\n\nis even more difficult to see how public functions could have existed before\n\nthe State they imply. We are always brought back to the idea of a State that\n\ncomes into the world fully formed and rises up in a single stroke, the uncon-\n\nditioned _Urstaat._\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nXI. _Which comes first?_\n\nWe shall call the first pole of capture imperial or despotic.

This is the _paradigm _of the bond, the knot. Such is\n\nthe regime of signs of the State: overcoding, or the Signifier. It is a system\nof  \n_machinic enslavement: _the first \"megamachine\" in the strict sense, to use\n\nMumford's term. A prodigious success in a single stroke; other States will\n\nbe mere runts measured against this model. The emperor-despot is not a\n\nking or a tyrant; these will come into existence only as a function of private\n\nproperty once it has arisen.\n\n9\n\nIn the imperial regime, everything is public:\n\nownership of land is communal, each individual is an owner only insofar as\n\nhe or she is a member of the community; the eminent property of the des-\n\npot is that of the supposed Unity of the communities; and the functionaries\n\nthemselves have land only if it comes with their position (although the\n\nposition may be hereditary). Money may exist, notably in the form of the\n\ntax that the functionaries owe the emperor, but it is not used for\n\nbuying-selling, since land does not exist as an alienable commodity. This\n\nis the regime of the _nexum, _the bond: something is lent or even given\n\nwithout a transfer of ownership, without private appropriation, and the\n\ncompensation for it does not come in the form of interest or profit for the\n\ndonor but rather as a \"rent\" that accrues to him, accompanying the lending\n\nof something for another's use or the granting of revenue.\n\n10\n\nMarx, the historian, and Childe, the archaeologist, are in agreement on\n\nthe following point: the archaic imperial State, which steps in to overcode\n\nagricultural communities, presupposes at least a certain level of devel-\n\nopment of these communities' productive forces since there must be a\n\npotential surplus capable of constituting a State stock, of supporting a spe-\n\ncialized handicrafts class (metallurgy), and of progressively giving rise to\n\npublic functions. That is why Marx links the archaic State to a certain\n\n\"mode of production.\" However, the origin of these Neolithic States is still\n\nbeing pushed back in time. What is at issue when the existence of\n\nnear-Paleolithic empires is conjectured is not simply the quantity of time;\n\nthe qualitative problem changes. Catal Hiiyiik, in Anatolia, makes\n\npossible a singularly reinforced imperial paradigm: it is a stock of\n\nuncultivated seeds and relatively tame animals from different territories\n\nthat performs, and makes it possible to perform, at first by chance,\n\nhybridizations and selections _from which agriculture and small-scale  \nanimal raising arise._\n\n_11_\n\n_ _It is easy to see the significance of this change in the\n\ngivens of the problem. It is no longer the stock that presupposes a potential\n\nsurplus, but the other way around. It is no longer the State that\n\npresupposes advanced agricultural communities and developed forces of\n\nproduction. On the contrary, the State is established directly in a milieu of\n\nhunter-gatherers having no prior\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)451.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 429\n\nagriculture or metallurgy, and it is the State that creates agriculture,\nanimal\n\nraising, and metallurgy; it does so first on its own soil, then imposes them\n\nupon the surrounding world. It is not the country that progressively creates\n\nthe town but the town that creates the country. It is not the State that pre-\n\nsupposes a mode of production; quite the opposite, it is the State that\n\nmakes production a \"mode.\" The last reasons for presuming a progressive\n\ndevelopment are invalidated. Like seeds in a sack: It all begins with a\n\nchance intermixing. The \"state and urban revolution\" may be Paleolithic,\n\nnot Neolithic as Childe believed.\n\nEvolutionism has been challenged in many different ways (zigzag move-\n\nments, stages skipped here or there, irreducible overall breaks). We have\n\nseen in particular how Pierre Clastres tried to shatter the evolutionist\n\nframework by means of the following two theses: (1) societies termed prim-\n\nitive are not societies without a State, in the sense that they failed to\nreach a\n\ncertain stage, but are counter-State societies organizing mechanisms that\n\nward off the State-form, which make its crystallization impossible; (2)\n\nwhen the State arises, it is in the form of an irreducible break, since it is\nnot\n\nthe result of a progressive development of the forces of production (even\n\nthe \"Neolithic revolution\" cannot be defined in terms of an economic\n\ninfrastructure).\n\n12\n\nHowever, one does not depart from evolutionism by\n\nestablishing a clean break. In the final state of his work, Clastres main-\n\ntained the preexistence and autarky of counter-State societies, and attrib-\n\nuted their workings to an overmysterious presentiment of what they\n\nwarded off and did not yet exist. More generally, one marvels at the bizarre\n\nindifference that ethnology manifests for archaeology. It seems as though\n\nethnologists, fenced off in their respective territories, are willing to com-\n\npare their territories in an abstract, or structural, way, if it comes to\nthat,\n\nbut refuse to set them against archaeological territories that would com-\n\npromise their autarky. They take snapshots of their primitives but rule out\n\nin advance the coexistence and superposition of the two maps, the\n\nethnographical and the archaeological. Catal Hiiyuk, however, would have\n\nhad a zone of influence extending two thousand miles; how can the\n\never-recurring problem of the relation of coexistence between primitive\n\nsocieties and empires, even those of Paleolithic times, be left unattended\n\nto? As long as archaeology is passed over, the question of the relation\n\nbetween ethnology and history is reduced to an idealist confrontation, and\n\nfails to wrest itself from the absurd theme of society without history, or\n\nsociety against history. _Everything is not of the State precisely because  \nthere have been States always and everywhere. _Not only does writing\n\npresuppose the State, but so do speech and language.

It is plausible that \"from the\n\nbeginning\" primitive societies have maintained distant ties to one another,\n\nnot just short-range ones, and that these ties were channeled through\n\nStates, even if States effected only a partial and local capture of them.\n\nSpeech communities and languages, independently of writing, do not\n\ndefine closed groups of people who understand one another but primarily\n\ndetermine relations between groups who do not understand one another: if\n\nthere is language, it is fundamentally between those who do not speak the\n\nsame tongue. Language is made for that, for translation, not for communi-\n\ncation. And in primitive societies there are as many tendencies that \"seek\"\n\nthe State, as many vectors working in the direction of the State, as there are\n\nmovements within the State or outside it that tend to stray from it or guard\n\nthemselves against it, or else to stimulate its evolution, or else already to\n\nabolish it: everything coexists, in perpetual interaction.\n\nEconomic evolutionism is an impossibility; even a ramified evolution,\n\n\"gatherers\u2014hunters\u2014animal breeders\u2014farmers-industrialists,\" is hardly\n\nbelievable. An evolutionary ethnology is no better: \"nomads\u2014\n\nseminomads\u2014sedentaries.\" Nor an ecological evolutionism: \"dispersed\n\nautarky of local groups\u2014villages and small towns\u2014cities\u2014States.\" All we\n\nneed to do is combine these abstract evolutions to make all of evolutionism\n\ncrumble; for example, it is the city that creates agriculture, without going\n\nthrough small towns. To take another example, the nomads do not precede\n\nthe sedentaries; rather, nomadism is a movement, a becoming that affects\n\nsedentaries, just as sedentarization is a stoppage that settles the nomads.\n\nGriaznov has shown in this connection that the most ancient nomadism\n\ncan be accurately attributed only to populations that abandoned their\n\nsemiurban sedentarity, or their primitive itineration, to set off nomadiz-\n\ning.\n\n13\n\nIt is under these conditions that the nomads invented the war\n\nmachine, as that which occupies or fills nomad space and opposes towns\n\nand States, which its tendency is to abolish. Primitive peoples already had\n\nmechanisms of war that converged to prevent the State formation; but\n\nthese mechanisms change when they gain autonomy in the form of a spe-\n\ncific nomadism machine that strikes back against the States. We cannot,\n\nhowever, infer from this even a zigzag evolution that would go from primi-\n\ntive peoples to States, from States to nomad war machines; or at least the\n\nzigzagging is not successive but passes through the loci of a topology that\n\ndefines primitive societies here, States there, and elsewhere war machines.\n\nAnd even when the State appropriates the war machine, once again chang-\n\ning its nature, it is a phenomenon of transport, of transfer, and not one of\n\nevolution. The nomad exists only in becoming, and in interaction; the\n\nsame goes for the primitive. All history does is to translate a coexistence\n\nof becomings into a succession.

Physics and biology present\n\nus with reverse causalities that are _without finality _but testify\nnonetheless\n\nto an action of the future on the present, or of the present on the past, for\n\nexample, the convergent wave and the anticipated potential, which imply\n\nan inversion of time. More than breaks or zigzags, it is these reverse causal-\n\nities that shatter evolution. Similarly, in the present context, it is not\nade-\n\nquate to say that the Neolithic or even Paleolithic State, once it appeared,\n\nreacted back on the surrounding world of the hunter-gatherers; it was\n\nalready acting before it appeared, as the actual limit these primitive socie-\n\nties warded off, or as the point toward which they converged but could not\n\nreach without self-destructing. These societies simultaneously have vec-\n\ntors moving in the direction of the State, mechanisms warding it off, and a\n\npoint of convergence that is repelled, set outside, as fast as it is\napproached.\n\nTo ward off is also to anticipate. Of course, it is not at all in the same way\n\nthat the State appears in existence, and that it preexists in the capacity of\na\n\nwarded-off limit; hence its irreducible contingency. But in order to give a\n\npositive meaning to the idea of a \"presentiment\" of what does not yet exist,\n\nit is necessary to demonstrate that what does not yet exist is already in\n\naction, in a different form than that of its existence. Once it has appeared,\n\nthe State reacts back on the hunter-gatherers, imposing upon them agricul-\n\nture, animal raising, an extensive division of labor, etc.; it acts,\ntherefore, in\n\nthe form of a centrifugal or divergent wave. But before appearing, the State\n\nalready acts in the form of the convergent or centripetal wave of the\n\nhunter-gatherers, _a wave that cancels itself out precisely at the point of  \nconvergence marking the inversion of signs or the appearance of the State _\n\n(hence the functional and intrinsic instability of these primitive societies).\n\n14\n\nIt is necessary from this standpoint to conceptualize the\n\ncontemporaneousness or coexistence of the two inverse movements, of\n\nthe two directions of time\u2014of the primitive peoples \"before\" the State,\n\nand of the State \"after\" the primitive peoples\u2014as if the two waves that seem\n\nto us to exclude or succeed each other unfolded simultaneously in an\n\n\"archaeological,\" micropo-litical, micrological, molecular field.\n\nThere exist collective mechanisms that simultaneously ward off and\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)454.png)\n\n0\n\n432 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nanticipate the formation of a central power. The appearance of a central\n\npower is thus a function of _a threshold or degree _beyond which what is\n\nanticipated takes on consistency or fails to, and what is conjured away\n\nceases to be so and arrives. This threshold of consistency, or of constraint,\n\nis not evolutionary but rather coexists with what has yet to cross it. More-\n\nover, a distinction must be made between different thresholds of consis-\n\ntency: the town and the State, however complementary, are not the same\n\nthing. The \"urban revolution\" and the \"state revolution\" may coincide but\n\ndo not meld. In both cases, there is a central power, but it does not assume\n\nthe same figure. Certain authors have made a distinction between the pala-\n\ntial or imperial system (temple-palace), and the urban, town system. In\n\nboth cases there is a town, but in one case the town is an outgrowth of the\n\npalace or temple, and in the other case the palace, the temple, is a concre-\n\ntion of the town. In one case, the town par excellence is the capital, and in\n\nthe other it is the metropolis. Sumer already attests to a town solution, as\n\nopposed to the imperial solution of Egypt. But to an even greater extent, it\n\nwas the Mediterranean world, with the Pelasgians, Phoenicians, Greeks,\n\nCarthaginians, that created an urban fabric distinct from the imperial\n\norganisms of the Orient.\n\n15\n\nOnce again, the question is one not of evolution\n\nbut of two thresholds of consistency that are themselves coexistent. They\n\ndiffer in several respects.\n\nThe town is the correlate of the road. The town exists only as a function\n\nof circulation, and of circuits; it is a remarkable point on the circuits that\n\ncreate it, and which it creates. It is defined by entries and exits; something\n\nmust enter it and exit from it. It imposes a frequency. It effects a polariza-\n\ntion of matter, inert, living or human; it causes the _phylum, _the flow, to\npass\n\nthrough specific places, along horizontal lines. It is a phenomenon of  \n_transconsistency, _a _network, _because it is fundamentally in contact with\n\nother towns. It represents a threshold of deterritorialization, because what-\n\never the material involved, it must be deterritorialized enough to enter the\n\nnetwork, to submit to the polarization, to follow the circuit of urban and\n\nroad recoding. The maximum deterritorialization appears in the tendency\n\nof maritime and commercial towns to separate off from the backcountry,\n\nfrom the countryside (Athens, Carthage, Venice). The commercial charac-\n\nter of the town has often been emphasized, but the commerce in question is\n\nalso spiritual, as in a network of monasteries or temple-cities. Towns are\n\ncircuit-points of every kind, which enter into counterpoint along horizon-\n\ntal lines; they effect a complete but local, town-by-town, integration. Each\n\none constitutes a central power, but it is a power of polarization or of the\n\nmiddle _{milieu), _of forced coordination. That is why this kind of power has\n\negalitarian pretensions, regardless of the form it takes: tyrannical, demo-\n\ncratic, oligarchic, aristocratic.

It makes\n\nthe town resonate with the countryside. It operates by stratification; in\n\nother words, it forms a vertical, hierarchized aggregate that spans the\n\nhorizontal lines in a dimension of depth. In retaining given elements, it\n\nnecessarily cuts off their relations with other elements, which become\n\nexterior, it inhibits, slows down, or controls those relations; if the State\nhas\n\na circuit of its own, it is an internal circuit dependent primarily upon\n\nresonance, it is a zone of recurrence that isolates itself from the remainder\n\nof the network, even if in order to do so it must exert even stricter controls\n\nover its relations with that remainder. The question is not to find out\n\nwhether what is retained is natural or artificial (boundaries), because in\n\nany event there is deterntorialization. But in this case deterritorialization\n\nis a result of the territory itself being taken as an object, as a material to\n\nstratify, to make resonate. Thus the central power of the State is\n\nhierarchical, and constitutes a civil-service sector; the center is not in the\n\nmiddle _{au milieu), _but on top, because the only way it can recombine\n\nwhat it isolates is through subordination. Of course, there is a multiplicity\n\nof States no less than of towns, but it is not the same type of multiplicity:\n\nthere are as many States as there are vertical cross sections in a\n\ndimension of depth, each separated from the others, whereas the town is\n\ninseparable from the horizontal network of towns. Each State is a global\n\n(not local) integration, a redundancy of resonance (not of frequency), an\n\noperation of the stratification of the territory (not of the polarization of\nthe\n\nmilieu).\n\nIt is possible to reconstruct how primitive societies warded off both\n\nthresholds while at the same time anticipating them. Levi-Strauss has\n\nshown that the same villages are susceptible to two presentations, one\n\nsegmentary and egalitarian, the other encompassing and hierarchized.\n\nThese are like _two potentials, _one anticipating a central point common to\n\ntwo horizontal segments, the other anticipating a central point external to\n\na straight line.\n\n17\n\nPrimitive societies do not lack formations of power; they\n\neven have many of them. But what prevents the potential central points\n\nfrom crystallizing, from taking on consistency, are precisely those mecha-\n\nnisms that keep the formations of power both from resonating together in a\n\nhigher point and from becoming polarized at a common point: the circles\n\nare not concentric, and the two segments require a third segment through\n\nwhich to communicate.\n\n18\n\nThis is the sense in which primitive societies\n\nhave crossed neither the town-threshold nor the State-threshold.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)456.png)\n\n0\n\n434 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nIf we now turn our attention to the two thresholds of consistency, it is\n\nclear that they imply a deterritorialization in relation to the primitive ter-\n\nritorial codes. It is futile to ask which came first, the city or the State,\nthe\n\nurban or state revolution, because the two are in reciprocal presupposi-\n\ntion. Both the melodic lines of the towns and the harmonic cross sections\n\nof the States are necessary to effect the striation of space. The only ques-\n\ntion that arises is the possibility that there may be an inverse relation at\n\nthe heart of this reciprocity. For although the archaic imperial State nec-\n\nessarily included towns of considerable size, they remained more or less\n\nstrictly subordinated to the State, depending on how complete the State's\n\nmonopoly over foreign trade was. On the other hand, the town tended to\n\nbreak free when the State's _overcoding _itself provoked _decoded _flows. A\n\ndecoding was coupled with the deterritorialization, and amplified it; the\n\nnecessary recoding was then achieved through a certain autonomy of the\n\ntowns, or else directly through corporative and commercial towns freed\n\nfrom the State-form. Thus towns arose that no longer had a connection to\n\ntheir own land, because they assured the trade between empires, or better,\n\nconstituted on their own a free commercial network with other towns.\n\nThere is therefore an adventure specific to towns in the zones where the\n\nmost intense decoding occurs, for example, the ancient Aegean world or\n\nthe Western world of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Could it not\n\nbe said that capitalism is the fruit of the towns, and arises when an urban\n\nrecoding tends to replace State overcoding? This, however, was not the\n\ncase. The towns did not create capitalism. The banking and commercial\n\ntowns, being unproductive and indifferent to the backcountry, did not\n\nperform a recoding without also inhibiting the general conjunction of\n\ndecoded flows. If it is true that they anticipated capitalism, they in turn\n\ndid not anticipate it without also warding it off. They do not cross this\n\nnew threshold. Thus it is necessary to expand the hypothesis of mecha-\n\nnisms both anticipatory and inhibiting: these mechanisms are at play not\n\nonly in primitive societies but also in the conflict of towns \"against\" the\n\nState _and _\"against\" capitalism. Finally, it was through the State-form and\n\nnot the town-form that capitalism triumphed; this occurred when the\n\nWestern States became models of realization for an axiomatic of decoded\n\nflows, and in that way resubjugated the towns. As Braudel says, there were  \n_\"always two runners, _the state and the town\"\u2014two forms and two speeds\n\nof deterritorialization\u2014and \"the state usually won. . . . everywhere in\n\nEurope, it disciplined the towns with instinctive relentlessness, whether\n\nor not it used violence.. . . [The states] caught up with the forward gallop\n\nof the towns.\"\n\n19\n\nBut the relation is a reciprocal one: if it is the modern\n\nState that gives capitalism its models of realization, what is thus realized\n\nis an independent, worldwide axiomatic that is like a single City,\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)457.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 435\n\nmegalopolis, or \"megamachine\" of which the States are parts, or neigh-\n\nborhoods.\n\nWe define social formations by _machinic processes _and not by modes of\n\nproduction (these on the contrary depend on the processes). Thus primi-\n\ntive societies are defined by mechanisms of prevention-anticipation; State\n\nsocieties are defined by apparatuses of capture; urban societies, by instru-\n\nments of polarization; nomadic societies, by war machines; and finally\n\ninternational, or rather ecumenical, organizations are defined by the\n\nencompassment of heterogeneous social formations. But precisely because\n\nthese processes are variables of coexistence that are the object of a social\n\ntopology, the various corresponding formations are coexistent. And they\n\ncoexist in two fashions, extrinsically and intrinsically. Primitive societies\n\ncannot ward off the formation of an empire or State without anticipating it,\n\nand they cannot anticipate it without its already being there, forming part\n\nof their horizon. And States cannot effect a capture unless what is captured\n\ncoexists, resists in primitive societies, or escapes under new forms, as\n\ntowns or war machines. . . The numerical composition of the war machine\n\nis superposed upon the primitive lineal organization and simultaneously\n\nopposes the geometric organization of the State and the physical organiza-\n\ntion of the town. It is this extrinsic coexistence\u2014interaction\u2014that is\n\nbrought to its own expression in international aggregates. For these obvi-\n\nously did not wait for capitalism before forming: as early as Neolithic\n\ntimes, even Paleolithic, we find traces of ecumenical organizations that tes-\n\ntify to the existence of long-distance trade, and simultaneously cut across\n\nthe most varied of social formations (as we have seen in the case of metal-\n\nlurgy). The problem of diffusion, or of diffusionism, is badly formulated if\n\none assumes a center at which the diffusion would begin. Diffusion occurs\n\nonly through the placing in communication of potentials of very different\n\norders: all diffusion happens in the in-between, goes between, like every-\n\nthing that \"grows\" of the rhizome type. An international ecumenical\n\norganization does not proceed from an imperial center that imposes itself\n\nupon and homogenizes an exterior milieu; neither is it reducible to rela-\n\ntions between formations of the same order, between States, for example\n\n(the League of Nations, the United Nations). On the contrary, it constitutes\n\nan intermediate milieu between the different coexistent orders. Therefore\n\nit is not exclusively commercial or economic, but is also religious, artistic,\n\netc. From this standpoint, we shall call an international organization any-\n\nthing that has the capacity to move through diverse social formations\n\nsimultaneously: States, towns, deserts, war machines, primitive societies.\n\nThe great commercial formations in history do not simply have city-poles,\n\nbut also primitive, imperial, and nomadic segments through which they\n\npass, perhaps issuing out again in another form.

It does not proceed by progressive\n\nhomoge-nization, or by totalization, but by the taking on of consistency or\n\nthe consolidation of the diverse as such. For example, monotheistic\n\nreligion is distinguished from territorial worship by its pretension to\n\nuniversality. But this pretension is not homogenizing, it makes itself felt\n\nonly by spreading everywhere; this was the case with Christianity, which\n\nbecame imperial and urban, but not without giving rise to bands, deserts,\n\nwar machines of its own.\n\n21\n\nSimilarly, there is no artistic movement that\n\ndoes not have its towns and empires, but also its nomads, bands, and\n\nprimitives.\n\nIt might be objected that, at least in the case of capitalism, international\n\neconomic relations, and at the limit all international relations, tend toward\n\nthe homogenization of social formations. One could cite not only the cold\n\nand concerted destruction of primitive societies but also the fall of the last\n\ndespotic formations, for example, the Ottoman Empire, which met capi-\n\ntalist demands with too much resistance and inertia. This objection, how-\n\never, is only partially accurate. To the extent that capitalism constitutes an\n\naxiomatic (production for the market), all States and all social formations\n\ntend to become _isomorphic _in their capacity as models of realization: there\n\nis but one centered world market, the capitalist one, in which even the\n\nso-called socialist countries participate. Worldwide organization thus\n\nceases to pass \"between\" heterogeneous formations since it assures the\n\nisomorphy of those formations. But it would be wrong to confuse\n\nisomorphy with homogeneity. For one thing, isomorphy allows, and even\n\nincites, a great heterogeneity among States (democratic, totalitarian, and,\n\nespecially, \"socialist\" States are not facades). For another thing, the\n\ninternational capitalist axiomatic effectively assures the isomorphy of the\n\ndiverse formations only where the domestic market is developing and\n\nexpanding, in other words, in \"the center.\" But it tolerates, in fact it\n\nrequires, a certain peripheral polymorphy, to the extent that it is not satu-\n\nrated, to the extent that it actively repels its own limits;\n\n22\n\nthis explains the\n\nexistence, at the periphery, of heteromorphic social formations, _which cer-  \ntainly do not constitute vestiges or transitional forms _since they realize an\n\nultramodern capitalist production (oil, mines, plantations, industrial\n\nequipment, steel, chemistry), but which are nonetheless precapitalist, or\n\nextracapitalist, owing to other aspects of their production and to the forced\n\ninadequacy of their domestic market in relation to the world market.\n\n23\n\nWhen international organization becomes the capitalist axiomatic, it con-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)459.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 437\n\ntinues to imply a heterogeneity of social formations, it gives rise to and\n\norganizes its \"Third World.\"\n\nThere is not only an external coexistence of formations but also an\n\nintrinsic coexistence of machinic processes. Each process can also function\n\nat a \"power\" other than its own; it can be taken up by a power correspond-\n\ning to another process. The State as apparatus of capture has a _power of  \nappropriation; _but this power does not consist solely in capturing all that\nit\n\ncan, all that is possible, of a matter defined as _phylum. _The apparatus of\n\ncapture also appropriates the war machine, the instruments of polariza-\n\ntion, and the anticipation-prevention mechanisms. This is to say, con-\n\nversely, that anticipation-prevention mechanisms have a high _power of  \ntransference: _they are at work not only in primitive societies, but move into\n\nthe towns that ward off the State-form, into the States that ward off capital-\n\nism, into capitalism itself, insofar as it wards off and repels its own\nlimits.\n\nAnd they are not satisfied to switch over to other powers but form new focal\n\npoints of resistance and contagion, as we have seen in the case of \"band\"\n\nphenomena, which have their own towns, their own brand of international-\n\nism, etc. Similarly, war machines have _a power of metamorphosis, _which of\n\ncourse allows them to be captured by States, but also to resist that capture\n\nand rise up again in other forms, with other \"objects\" besides war (revolu-\n\ntion?). Each power is a force of deterritorialization that can go along with\n\nthe others or go against them (even primitive societies have their vectors of\n\ndeterritorialization). Each process can switch over to other powers, but\n\nalso subordinate other processes to its own power.\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nXII. _Capture._\n\nIs it possible to conceive of an \"exchange\" between separate primitive\n\ngroups, independent of any reference to such notions as stock, labor, and\n\ncommodity? It seems that a modified marginalism provides a basis for a\n\nhypothesis. For the interest of marginalism resides not in its economic the-\n\nory, which is extremely weak, but in a logical power that makes Jevons, for\n\nexample, a kind of Lewis Carroll of economics. Take two abstract groups,\n\none of which (A) gives seeds and receives axes, while the other (B) does the\n\nopposite. What is the collective evaluation of the objects based on? It is\n\nbased on the _idea _of the last objects received, or rather receivable, on\neach\n\nside. By \"last\" or \"marginal\" we must understand not the most recent, nor\n\nthe final, but rather the penultimate, the next to the last, in other words,\nthe\n\nlast one _before _the apparent exchange loses its appeal for the exchangers,\nor\n\nforces them to modify their respective assemblages, to enter another\n\nassemblage. We will consider that the farmer-gatherer group A, which\n\nreceives axes, has an \"idea\" of the number of axes that would force it to\n\nchange assemblage; and the manufacturing group B, of the quantity of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)460.png)\n\n0\n\n438 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nseeds that would force it to change assemblage. We may say, then, that the\n\nseed-ax relation is determined by the last quantity of seeds (for group B)\n\ncorresponding to the last ax (for group A). The last as the object of a\ncollec-\n\ntive evaluation determines the value of the entire series. It marks the exact\n\npoint at which the assemblage must reproduce itself, begin a new operation\n\nperiod or a new cycle, lodge itself on another territory, and beyond which\n\nthe assemblage could not continue as such. This is indeed a\n\nnext-to-the-last, a penultimate, since it comes before the ultimate. The\n\nultimate is when the assemblage must change its nature: B would have to\n\nplant the excess seeds. A would have to increase the rhythm of its own\n\nplantings and remain on the same land.\n\nWe can now posit a conceptual difference between the \"limit\" and the\n\n\"threshold\": the limit designates the penultimate marking a necessary\n\nrebeginning, and the threshold the ultimate marking an inevitable change.\n\nIt is an economic given of every enterprise to include an evaluation of the\n\nlimit beyond which the enterprise would have to modify its structure.\n\nMarginalism claims to demonstrate the frequency of this penultimate\n\nmechanism: it applies not only to the last exchangeable objects but also to\n\nthe last producible object, or the last producer him- or herself, the marginal\n\nor limit-producer before the assemblage changes.\n\n24\n\nThis is an economics of\n\neveryday life. For example, what does an alcoholic call the _last glass? _The\n\nalcoholic makes a subjective evaluation of how much he or she can tolerate.\n\nWhat can be tolerated is precisely the limit at which, as the alcoholic sees\nit,\n\nhe or she will be able to start over again (after a rest, a pause ...). But\n\nbeyond that limit there lies a threshold that would cause the alcoholic to\n\nchange assemblage: it would change either the nature of the drinks or the\n\ncustomary places and hours of the drinking. Or worse yet, the alcoholic\n\nwould enter a suicidal assemblage, or a medical, hospital assemblage, etc.\n\nIt is of little importance that the alcoholic may be fooling him- or herself,\nor\n\nmakes a very ambiguous use of the theme \"I'm going to stop,\" the theme of\n\nthe last one. What counts is the existence of a spontaneous marginal crite-\n\nrion and marginalist evaluation determining the value of the entire series\n\nof \"glasses.\" The same goes for having _the last wordin _a domestic-squabble\n\nassemblage. Both partners evaluate from the start the volume or density of\n\nthe last word that would give them the advantage and conclude the discus-\n\nsion, marking the end of an operation period or cycle of the assemblage,\n\nallowing it to start all over again. Both calculate their words in accordance\n\nwith their evaluation of this last word, and the vaguely agreed time for it to\n\ncome. And beyond the last (penultimate) word there lie still other words,\n\nthis time final words that would cause them to enter another assemblage,\n\ndivorce, for example, because they would have overstepped \"bounds.\" The\n\nsame could be said for the _last love. _Proust has shown how a love can be\nori-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)461.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 439\n\nented toward its own limit, its own margin: it repeats its own ending.

The equalization results from the two heterogene-\n\nous series, the exchange or communication results from two monologues  \n_(palabre). _There is neither exchange value nor use value but rather an eval-\n\nuation of the last by both parties (a calculation of the risk involved in\ncross-\n\ning the limit), an anticipation-evaluation that takes into account the ritual\n\ncharacter as well as the utilitarian, the serial character as well as the\n\nexchangist. The evaluation of the limit is there from the start in both\n\ngroups, and already governs the first \"exchange\" between them. Of course\n\nthere is groping in the dark; the evaluation is inseparable from a collective\n\nfeeling out. But it does not bear on the quantity of social labor but on the\n\nidea of the last on both sides; the speed with which it is accomplished var-\n\nies, but it is always done faster than the time necessary effectively to\narrive\n\nat the last object, or even to pass from one operation to another.\n\n25\n\nThis is\n\nthe sense in which the evaluation is essentially anticipatory, that it is\n\nalready present in the first terms of the series. It can be seen that marginal\n\nutility (pertaining to the last objects receivable on both sides) is relative\nnot\n\nto an abstractly posited stock but to the respective assemblages of the two\n\ngroups. Pareto was moving in this direction when he spoke of \"ophelimity\"\n\nrather than of marginal utility.\n\n26\n\nThe issue is one of_desirability _as an assem-\n\nblage component: every group desires according to the value of the last\n\nreceivable object beyond which it would be obliged to change assemblage.\n\nAnd every assemblage has two sides, the machining of bodies or objects,\n\nand group enunciation. The evaluation of the last is the collective enuncia-\n\ntion to which the _entire series _of objects corresponds; in other words, it\nis an\n\nassemblage cycle or operation period. Exchangist primitive groups thus\n\nappear to be serial groups. Theirs is a special regime, even with respect to\n\nviolence. For even violence can be submitted to a marginal ritual treat-\n\nment, that is, to an evaluation of the \"last violence\" insofar as it impreg-\n\nnates the entire series of blows (beyond which another regime of violence\n\nwould begin). We previously defined primitive societies by the existence of  \n_anticipation-prevention _mechanisms. Now we can see more clearly how\n\nthese mechanisms are constituted and distributed: it is the evaluation of\n\nthe last as limit that constitutes an anticipation and simultaneously wards\n\noff the last as threshold or ultimate (a new assemblage).\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)462.png)\n\n0\n\n440 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nThe threshold comes \"after\" the limit, \"after\" the last receivable objects:\n\nit marks the moment when the apparent exchange is no longer of interest.\n\nWe believe that it is precisely at this moment that stockpiling begins; be-\n\nforehand, there may be exchange granaries, granaries specifically for\n\nexchange purposes, but there is no stock in the strict sense. Exchange does\n\nnot assume a preexistent stock, it assumes only a certain \"elasticity.\" Stock-\n\npiling begins only once exchange has lost its interest, its desirability for\n\nboth parties. Additionally, conditions must exist giving stockpiling an\n\ninterest in its own right, a desirability of its own (otherwise, the objects\n\nwould be destroyed or depleted rather than stockpiled: depletion is the\n\nmeans by which primitive groups ward off the stock and maintain their\n\nassemblage).

The stock seems to us to have a necessary correlate: _either the  \ncoexistence of simultaneously exploited territories, or a succession of\nexploi-  \ntations on one and the same territory. _It is at this point that the\nterritories\n\nform a Land, are superseded by a Land. This is the assemblage that neces-\n\nsarily includes stockpiling, and which constitutes in the first case an exten-\n\nsive system of cultivation, in the second case an intensive system of\n\ncultivation (following Jane Jacobs's paradigm). The way in which the\n\nstock-threshold differs from the exchange-limit is now clear: primitive\n\nassemblages of hunter-gatherers have an operation period defined by the\n\nexploitation of a territory; the law is one of temporal succession because\n\nthe assemblage perseveres only by switching territories at the conclusion of\n\neach operation period (itinerancy, itineration); and within each operation\n\nperiod there is a repetition or temporal series that tends toward the last\n\nobject as an \"index,\" as the marginal or limit-object of the territory (this\n\niteration will govern the apparent exchange). On the other hand, in the\n\nother assemblage, in the stock assemblage, the law is one of spatial coexis-\n\ntence and concerns the simultaneous exploitation of different territories;\n\nor, when the exploitation is successive, the succession of operation periods\n\nbears on one and the same territory; and in the framework of each opera-\n\ntion period or exploitation the force of serial iteration is superseded by a\n\npower of symmetry, reflection, and global comparison. In solely descrip-\n\ntive terms, we therefore distinguish between serial, itinerant, or territorial\n\nassemblages (which operate by codes) and sedentary, global, or Land\n\nassemblages (which operate by overcoding).\n\nGround rent, in its abstract model, appears precisely when a compari-\n\nson is drawn between different simultaneously exploited territories, or\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)463.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 441\n\nbetween the successive exploitations of the same territory.

The category of the _last\n_con-\n\nfirms once again its economic importance, but it has totally changed mean-\n\ning: it no longer designates the end point of a self-fulfilling movement but\n\nthe center of symmetry for two movements, one of which is descending and\n\nthe other ascending; it no longer designates the limit of an ordinal series\n\nbut the lowest element in a cardinal set, that set's threshold\u2014the least fer-\n\ntile land in the set of simultaneously exploited lands.\n\n28\n\nGround rent\n\nhomogenizes, equalizes different conditions of productivity by linking the\n\nexcess of the highest conditions of productivity over the lowest to a _land-  \nowner: _since the price (profit included) is established on the basis of the\n\nleast productive land, rent taps the surplus profit accruing to the best\nlands;\n\nit taps \"the difference between the product of two equal amounts of capital\n\nand labor.\"\n\n29\n\nThis is the very model of an apparatus of capture, inseparable\n\nfrom a process of relative deterritorialization. The land as the object of\n\nagriculture in fact implies a deterritorialization, because instead of people\n\nbeing distributed in an itinerant territory, pieces of land are distributed\n\namong people according to a common quantitative criterion (the fertility\n\nof plots of equal surface area). That is why the earth, unlike other elements,\n\nforms the basis of a striation, proceeding by geometry, symmetry, and com-\n\nparison. The other elements, water, air, wind, and subsoil, cannot be stri-\n\nated and for that very reason bear rent only by virtue of their emplacement,\n\nin other words, as a function of the land.\n\n30\n\nThe land has two potentialities\n\nof deterritorialization: (1) its differences in quality are _comparable to\n_one\n\nanother, from the standpoint of a quantity establishing a correspondence\n\nbetween them and exploitable pieces of land; (2) the set of exploited lands\n\nis _appropriable, _as opposed to exterior unclaimed land, from the stand-\n\npoint of a monopoly that fixes the landowner or -owners.\n\n31\n\nThe second\n\npotentiality is the necessary condition for the first.

Not only does labor concern the stock\u2014either its constitu-\n\ntion, conservation, reconstitution, or utilization\u2014but labor itself is stock-\n\npiled activity, just as the worker is a stockpiled \"actant.\" Moreover, even\n\nwhen labor is clearly separated from surplus labor, they cannot be held to\n\nbe independent: there is no so-called necessary labor, and beyond that sur-\n\nplus labor. Labor and surplus labor are strictly the same thing; the first\nterm\n\nis applied to the quantitative comparison of activities, the second to the\n\nmonopolistic appropriation of labor by the entrepreneur (and no longer\n\nthe landowner). As we have seen, even when they are distinct and separate,\n\nthere is no labor that is not predicated on surplus labor. Surplus labor is\nnot\n\nthat which exceeds labor; on the contrary, labor is that which is subtracted\n\nfrom surplus labor and presupposes it. It is only in this context that one\n\nmay speak of labor value, and of an evaluation bearing on the quantity of\n\nsocial labor, whereas primitive groups were under a regime of free action or\n\nactivity in continuous variation. Since it depends on surplus labor and sur-\n\nplus value, entrepreneurial profit is just as much an apparatus of capture as\n\nproprietary rent: not only does surplus labor capture labor, and\n\nlandownership the earth, but labor and surplus labor are the apparatus of\n\ncapture of activity, just as the comparison of lands and the appropriation of\n\nland are the apparatus of capture of the territory.\n\n32\n\nFinally, there is a third apparatus of capture in addition to rent and\n\nprofit: taxation. To understand this third form, and its creative range, we\n\nmust first determine the internal relation upon which the commodity\n\ndepends. Edouard Will has shown, in relation to the Greek city and in par-\n\nticular the Corinthian tyranny, that money derived not from exchange, the\n\ncommodity, or the demands of commerce, but from taxation, which first\n\nintroduces the possibility of an equivalence money = goods or services and\n\nwhich makes money a general equivalent. In effect, money is a correlate of\n\nthe stock; it is a subset of the stock in that it can be constituted by any\nobject\n\nthat can be preserved over the long term. In the case of Corinth, metal\n\nmoney was first distributed to the \"poor\" (in their capacity as producers).\n\nwho used it to by land rights; it thus passed into the hands of the \"rich,\" on\n\nthe condition that it not stop there, that everyone, rich and poor, pay a tax,\n\nthe poor in goods or services, the rich in money, such that an equivalence\n\nmoney-goods and services was established.\n\n33\n\nWe will return to the signifi-\n\ncance of this reference to rich and poor in the already late case of Corinth.\nBut\n\nbeyond the context and particularities of this example, money is always\n\ndistributed by an apparatus of power under conditions of conservation,\n\ncirculation, and turnover, so that an equivalence goods-services-money\n\ncan be established. We therefore do not believe in a succession.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)465.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 443\n\naccording to which labor rent would come first, followed by rent in kind,  \nfollowed by money rent.\n\n34\n\nIt is directly in taxation that the equivalence and\n\nsimultaneity of the three develop. As a general rule, it is taxation that  \nmonetarizes the economy; it is taxation that creates money, and it neces-  \nsarily creates it in motion, in circulation, with turnover, and also in a\ncorre-  \nspondence with services and goods in the current of that circulation. The  \nState finds in taxation the means for foreign trade, insofar as it appropri-  \nates that trade. Yet it is not from trade but from taxation that the  \nmoney-form derives.\n\n35\n\nAnd the money-form thus derived from taxation\n\nmakes possible a monopolistic appropriation of outside exchange by the  \nState (monetarized trade). Everything is different in the regime of  \nexchanges. We are no longer in the \"primitive\" situation where exchange is  \ncarried out indirectly, subjectively, through the respective equalization of  \nthe last receivable objects (the law of demand). Of course, exchange  \nremains what it is in essence, that is to say, unequal, productive of an  \nequalization resulting from inequality: but this time there is direct  \ncomparison, objective pricing, and monetary equalization (the law of  \nsupply). It is through taxation that goods and services come to be like  \ncommodities, and the commodity comes to be measured and equalized by  \nmoney. That is why, even today, the meaning and impact of taxation  \nappear in what is called indirect taxation, in other words, a tax that is  \nincluded in the price and influences the value of the commodity,  \nindependent of and outside the market.\n\n36\n\nHowever, the indirect tax is not\n\nsimply an additional element that is tacked onto prices and inflates them. It  \nis only the index or expression of a deeper movement, in which the tax  \nconstitutes the first layer of an \"objective\" price, the monetary magnet to  \nwhich the other elements\u2014price, rent, and profit\u2014add on and adhere,  \nconverging in the same apparatus of capture. It was a great moment in  \ncapitalism when the capitalists realized that taxation could be productive,  \nthat it could be particularly favorable to profits and even to rents. But as  \nwith indirect taxation, this is a favorable case; it should not obscure an  \neven deeper and more archaic accord, a convergence and essential identity  \nbetween three aspects of a single apparatus. A three-headed apparatus of  \ncapture, a \"trinity formula\" derived from that of Marx (although it  \ndistributes things differently):\n\n37\n\nLAND\n\n(as opposed to territory)\n\na) Direct comparison of lands, dif-\n\nferential rent;\n\nb) Monopolistic appropriation of\n\nland, absolute rent.\n\nRent The\n\nLandowner\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)466.png)\n\n444 D 7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nWORK\n\n(as opposed to activity)\n\nStock  a) Direct comparison of activities,\n\nProfit\n\nlabor;\n\nThe Entrepreneur\n\nb) Monopolistic appropriation of\n\nlabor, surplus labor.\n\nMONEY (as\n\nopposed to exchange)\n\na) Direct comparison of the objects\n\nexchanged, the commodity;\n\nTaxation\n\nb) Monopolistic appropriation of the\n\nThe Banker\n\nmeans of comparison, the issu\n\nance of currency.\n\n1. The stock has three simultaneous aspects: land and seeds, tools,\n\nmoney. Land is stockpiled territory, the tool is stockpiled activity, and\n\nmoney is stockpiled exchange. But the stock does not _come _from either ter-\n\nritories, activities, or exchanges. It marks another assemblage; it comes\n\nfrom that other assemblage.\n\n2. That assemblage is the \"megamachine,\" or the apparatus of capture,\n\nthe archaic empire. It functions in three modes, which correspond to the\n\nthree aspects of the stock: rent, profit, taxation. And the three modes con-\n\nverge and coincide in it, in an agency of overcoding (or signifiance): the\n\ndespot, at once the eminent landowner, entrepreneur of large-scale proj-\n\nects, and master of taxes and prices. This is like three capitalizations of\n\npower, or three articulations of \"capital.\"\n\n3. What forms the apparatus of capture are two operations always\n\nfound in the convergent modes: direct comparison and monopolistic\n\nappropriation. And the comparison always presupposes the appropriation:\n\nlabor presupposes surplus labor; differential rent presupposes absolute\n\nrent; commercial money presupposes taxation. The apparatus of capture\n\nconstitutes a general space of comparison and a mobile center of\n\nappropriation. This is a white wall/black hole system of the kind that, as we\n\nhave seen, constitutes the _face _of the despot. A point of resonance circu-\n\nlates in a space of comparison and constitutes that space as it circulates.\n\nThat is what distinguishes the State apparatus from primitive mecha-\n\nnisms, with their noncoexistent territories and nonresonating centers.\n\nWhat begins with the State or the apparatus of capture is a general\n\nsemiology that overcodes the primitive semiotic systems.

(In this sense, the associationist philosophers\n\nwere not wrong in explaining political power by operations of the mind\n\ndependent upon the association of ideas.)\n\nBernard Schmitt has proposed a model of the apparatus of capture that\n\ntakes into account the operations of comparison and appropriation. This\n\nmodel admittedly revolves around money as a capitalist economics. But it\n\nseems to be based on abstract principles that transcend these limits.\n\n38\n\nA. The point of departure is an undivided flow that has yet to be ap\n\npropriated or compared, a \"pure availability,\" \"nonpossession and non-\n\nwealth\": this is precisely what occurs when banks create money, but taken\n\nmore generally it is the establishment of the stock, which is the creation of\n\nan undivided flow.\n\nB. The undivided flow becomes divided to the extent it is allocated to\n\nthe \"factors,\" distributed to the \"factors.\" There is only one kind of factor,\n\nthe immediate producers. We could call them the \"poor\" and say that the\n\nflow is distributed among the poor. But this would be inaccurate because\n\nthere are no preexistent \"rich.\" What counts, the important thing, is that\n\nthe producers do not yet acquire possession of what is distributed to them,\n\nand that what is distributed to them is not yet wealth: _remuneration _\n\nassumes neither comparison and appropriation, nor buying-selling; it is\n\nmuch more an operation of the _nexum _type. There is only equality between\n\nset B and set A, between the distributed set and the undivided set. The dis\n\ntributed set could be called _nominal wage; _nominal wages are the form of\n\nexpression of the entire undivided set (\"the entire nominal expression,\" or\n\nas it is often put, \"the expression of total national income\"). This is the\n\npoint at which the apparatus of capture becomes semiological.\n\nC. Thus it cannot even be said that wages, conceived as distribution,\n\nremuneration, constitute a purchase; on the contrary, purchasing power\n\nderives from wages: \"The remuneration of the producers is not a purchase,\n\nit is the operation by which purchasing becomes possible in a second\n\nmoment, when money begins to exercise its new power.\" It is after it has\n\nbeen distributed that set B becomes wealth, or acquires a comparative\n\npower, in relation to something else entirely. This something else is the\n\ndeterminate set of the goods that have been produced and are thus purchas\n\nable. At first heterogeneous to goods and products, money later becomes a\n\ngood homogeneous to the products it can buy; it acquires a purchasing\n\npower that is extinguished with the real purchase. Or more generally,\n\nbetween the two sets, the distributed set B and the set of real goods C, there\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)468.png)\n\n0\n\n446 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nis established a _correspondence, _a _comparison _(\"the power of acquisition\nis\n\ncreated in direct conjunction with the set of real productions\").\n\nD. This is where the mystery or the magic resides, in a kind of disjunc-\n\ntion. For if we call B' the comparative set, in other words, the set placed in\n\ncorrespondence with the real goods, we see that it is necessarily smaller\n\nthan the distributed set. B' is necessarily smaller than B: even if we assume\n\nthat purchasing power has available to it all of the objects produced during\n\na given period, the distributed set is always greater than the set that is\nused\n\nor compared, meaning that the immediate producers are able to convert\n\nonly a portion of the distributed set. _Real wages _are only a portion of\nnomi-\n\nnal wages; similarly, \"useful\" labor is only a portion of labor, and\n\"utilized\"\n\nland is only a portion of the land that has been distributed. We shall call\n\nCapture this difference or excess constitutive of profit, surplus labor, or\nthe\n\nsurplus product: \"Nominal wages include everything, but the wage-earners\n\nretain only the income _they succeed in converting into goods; _they lose the\n\nincome siphoned off by the enterprises.\" It can be said that the whole was in\n\nfact distributed to the \"poor\"; the poor, however, find themselves extorted\n\nof everything they do not succeed in converting in the course of this strange\n\nrace: the capture effects an inversion of the wave or of the divisible flow.\nIt\n\nis precisely capture that is the object of monopolistic appropriation. And\n\nthis appropriation (by the \"rich\") does not come after: it is included in\n\nnominal wages, while eluding real wages. It is between the two, it inserts\n\nitself between the distribution without possession and the conversion by\n\ncorrespondence or comparison; it expresses the difference in power\n\nbetween the two sets, between B' and B. In the end, there is no mystery at\n\nall: _the mechanism of capture contributes from the outset to the constitution  \nof the aggregate upon which the capture is effectuated._\n\nThis schema, according to its author, is very difficult to understand, and\n\nyet it is operative. It consists in bringing into relief an abstract machine\nof\n\ncapture or of extortion by presenting a very specific \"order of reasons.\" For\n\nexample, remuneration is not itself a purchase since purchasing power\n\nderives from it. As Schmitt says, there is neither thief nor victim, for the\n\nproducer only loses what he does not have and has no chance of acquiring:\n\nas in seventeenth-century philosophy, there are negations but not priva-\n\ntion .. . And everything coexists in this logical apparatus of capture. Any\n\nsuccession is purely logical: the capture in itself appears between B and C,\n\nbut exists as well between A and B, between C and A; it impregnates the\n\nentire apparatus, it acts as a nonlocalizable liaison for the system. The\n\nsame goes for surplus labor: How could one specify its location since labor\n\npresupposes it? Now the State\u2014the archaic imperial State in any case\u2014is\n\nthis very apparatus. It is always a mistake to appeal to a supplementary\n\nexplanation for the State: this pushes the State back behind the State, ad\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)469.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 447\n\ninfinitum. It is better to leave it where it is from the start, for it exists\npunc-\n\ntually, beyond the limit of the primitive series. It is enough for this point\nof\n\ncomparison and appropriation to be effectively occupied in order for the\n\napparatus of capture to function, an apparatus that overcodes the primi-\n\ntive codes, substitutes sets for the series, or reverses the direction of the\n\nsigns. This point is necessarily occupied, effectuated, because it already\n\nexists in the convergent wave that moves through the primitive series and\n\ndraws them toward a threshold at which, after passing their limits, the wave\n\nitself changes direction. Primitive peoples have always existed only as ves-\n\ntiges, already plied by the reversible wave that carries them off (vector of\n\ndeterritorialization). What is contingent upon external circumstances is\n\nonly the place where the apparatus is effectuated\u2014the place where the\n\nagricultural \"mode of production\" was able to arise: the Orient. It is in this\n\nsense that the apparatus is abstract. But in itself, it marks not simply an\n\nabstract possibility of reversibility but the real existence of a point of\ninver-\n\nsion as an autonomous, irreducible phenomenon.\n\nHence the very particular character of State violence: it is very difficult\n\nto pinpoint this violence because it always presents itself as\n\npreaccom-plished. It is not even adequate to say that the violence rests with\n\nthe mode of production. Marx made the observation in the case of\n\ncapitalism: there is a violence _that necessarily operates through the State,\n_\n\nprecedes the capitalist mode of production, constitutes the \"primitive\n\naccumulation,\" and makes possible the capitalist mode of production itself.\n\nFrom a standpoint within the capitalist mode of production, it is very\n\ndifficult to say who is the thief and who the victim, or even where the\n\nviolence resides. That is because the worker is born entirely naked and\n\nthe capitalist objectively \"clothed,\" an independent owner. That which gave\n\nthe worker and the capitalist this form eludes us because it operated in other\n\nmodes of production. It is a violence that posits itself as preaccomplished,\n\neven though it is reactivated every day.\n\n39\n\nThis is the place to say it, if ever\n\nthere was one: _the mutilation is prior, preestablished. _However, these\n\nanalyses of Marx should be enlarged upon. For the fact remains that there\n\nis a primitive accumulation that, far from deriving from the agricultural\n\nmode of production, precedes it: as a general rule, there is primitive\n\naccumulation whenever an apparatus of capture is mounted, with that very\n\nparticular kind of violence that creates or contributes to the creation of\n\nthat which it is directed against, and thus presupposes itself.\n\n40\n\nThe problem\n\nthen becomes one of distinguishing between regimes of violence. We can\n\ndraw a distinction between struggle, war, crime and policing as so many\n\nregimes of violence. _Struggle _would be like the regime of primitive\n\nviolence (including primitive \"wars\"); it is a blow-by-blow violence,\n\nwhich is not without its code, since the value of the blows is fixed according\n\nto the law of the series, as a function of the value of\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)470.png)\n\n0\n\n448 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nthe last exchangeable blow, or of the last woman to conquer, etc. Thus there\n\nis a certain ritualization of violence. _War, _at least when linked to the war\n\nmachine, is another regime, because it implies the mobilization and\n\nautonomization of a violence directed first and essentially against the\n\nState apparatus (the war machine is in this sense the invention of a primary\n\nnomadic organization that turns against the State). _Crime _is something\n\nelse, because it is a violence of illegality that consists in taking\npossession of\n\nsomething to which one has no \"right,\" in capturing something one does\n\nnot have a \"right\" to capture. But _State policing or lawful violence _is\nsome-\n\nthing else again, because it consists in capturing while simultaneously\n\nconstituting a right to capture. It is an incorporated, structural violence\n\ndistinct from every kind of direct violence. The State has often been\n\ndefined by a \"monopoly of violence,\" but this definition leads back to\n\nanother definition that describes the State as a \"state of Law\"  \n_(Rechts-staat). _State overcoding is precisely this structural violence that\n\ndefines the law, \"police\" violence and not the violence of war. There is\n\nlawful violence wherever violence contributes to the creation of that which\n\nit is used against, or as Marx says, wherever capture contributes to the\n\ncreation of that which it captures. This is very different from criminal\n\nviolence. It is also why, _in contradistinction to _primitive violence, State\nor\n\nlawful violence always seems to presuppose itself, for it preexists its own\n\nuse: the State can in this way say that violence is \"primal,\" that it is\nsimply a\n\nnatural phenomenon the responsibility for which does not lie with the\n\nState, which uses violence only against the violent, against\n\n\"criminals\"\u2014against primitives, against nomads\u2014in order that peace\n\nmay reign.\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nXIII. _The State and its forms._\n\nWe start with the archaic imperial State: overcoding, apparatus of cap-\n\nture, machine of enslavement. It comprises a particular kind of property,\n\nmoney, public works\u2014a formula complete in a single stroke but one that\n\npresupposes nothing \"private\" and does not even assume a preexistent\n\nmode of production since it is what gives rise to the mode of production.\n\nThe point of departure that the preceding analyses give us is well estab-\n\nlished by archaeology. The question now becomes: Once the State has\n\nappeared, formed in a single stroke, how will it evolve? What are its factors\n\nof evolution or mutation, and what is the relation between evolved States\n\nand the archaic imperial State?\n\nThe principle of evolution is internal, whatever the external factors that\n\ncontribute to it. _The archaic State does not overcode without also freeing a  \nlarge quantity of decoded flows that escape from it. _Let us recall that\n\"decod-\n\ning\" does not signify the state of a flow whose code is understood _(compris)\n_\n\n(deciphered, translatable, assimilable), but, in a more radical sense, the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)471.png)\n\n0 7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE D 449\n\nstate of a flow that is no longer contained in _(compris dans) _it own code,\nthat  \nescapes it own code. On the one hand, when the primitive codes cease to be  \nself-regulating and are subordinated to the higher agency, flows that had been  \ncoded in a relative way by the primitive communities find the opportunity to  \nescape. But on the other hand, _the overcoding of the archaic State itself\nmakes  \npossible and gives rise to new flows that escape from it. _The State does not  \ncreated large-scale works without a flow of independent labor escaping its  \nbureaucracy (notably in the mines and in metallurgy). It does not create the  \nmonetary form of the tax without flows of money escaping, and nourishing or  \nbringing into being other powers (notably in commerce and banking). And above  \nall, it does not created a system of public property without a flow of private  \nappropriation growing up _beside _it, then beginning to pass beyond its grasp;\nthis  \nprivate property does not itself issue from the archaic system but is\nconstituted  \non the margins, all the more necessarily and inevitably, slipping through the\nnet  \nof overcoding. It is undoubtedly Tokei who has formulated the problem of an  \norigin of private property in the most serious way, in the context of a system\nthat  \nseems to exclude it from every angle. For private property can arise neither\non  \nthe side of the emperor-despot not on the side of the peasants, whose autonomy  \nis tied to communal possession, nor on the side of the functionaries whose  \nexistence and income are based on that public communal form (\"the aristocrats  \ncan under these conditions become petty despots but not private landowners\").  \nEven the slaves belong to the community or the public function. The question  \nthen becomes, Are there people who are constituted in the overcoding empire,  \nbut constituted as necessarily excluded and decoded? Tokei's answer is the\n_freed  \nslaves. _It is they who have no place.

According to V. Gordon\n\nChilde's great archaeological thesis, the archaic imperial State implies a\n\nstockpiled agricultural surplus, which makes possible the maintenance of a\n\nspecialized body of mercantile and metallurgical artisans. Indeed, the sur-\n\nplus as the content proper to overcoding must be not only stockpiled but\n\nabsorbed, consumed, realized. Doubtless, this economic requirement that\n\nthe surplus be absorbed is one of the principal aspects of the appropriation\n\nof the war machine by the imperial State: The military institution is from\n\nthe start one of the most effective means of absorbing surplus. If, however,\n\nwe assume that the bureaucratic and military institutions are not enough,\n\nthe way is cleared for this specialized body of nonagricultural artisans,\n\nwhose labor will reinforce the sedentarization of agriculture. It was in\n\nAfro-Asia and the Orient that all of these conditions were fulfilled and\n\nthat the State apparatus was invented: in the Middle East, Egypt, and\n\nMesopotamia, but also in the valley of the Indus (and in the Far East). That\n\nwas where agricultural stock and its bureaucratic, military, but also\n\nmetallurgical and commercial concomitants came into being. But this\n\noriental or imperial \"solution\" is threatened by an impasse: State\n\novercoding keeps the metallurgists, both craft and mercantile, within strict\n\nbounds, under powerful bureaucratic control, with monopolistic\n\nappropriation of foreign trade in the service of a ruling class, so that the\n\npeasants themselves benefit little from the State innovations. So it is\n\nindeed true that the State-form spreads and that archaeology discovers it\n\neverywhere on the horizon of Western history in the Aegean world. But\n\nnot under the same conditions. Minos and Mycenae are more a caricature\n\nof an empire, Agamemnon of Mycenae is not the Chinese emperor or\n\nEgyptian pharaoh; the Egyptian can say to the Greeks: \"You will always\n\nbe like children...\" That is because the Aegean peoples were both too far\n\naway to fall into the oriental sphere and too poor to stockpile a surplus\n\nthemselves, but neither far enough away nor impoverished enough to\n\nignore the markets of the Orient. Moreover, oriental overcoding itself\n\nassigned its merchants a long-distance role. Thus the Aegean peoples\n\nfound themselves in a situation where they could take advantage of the\n\noriental agricultural stock _without having to constitute one for themselves:\n_\n\nthey plundered it when they could, and on a more regular basis procured a\n\nshare of it in exchange for raw materials (notably wood and metals),\n\ncoming from as far away as Central and Western Europe. Of course, the\n\nOrient continually had to reproduce its stocks; but formally, it had made a\n\nmove \"once and for all,\" from which the West benefited without having to\n\nreproduce it. It follows that the metallurgical artisans and the merchants\n\nassumed an entirely different status in the West, since their existence did\n\nnot directly depend on a surplus accumulated by a local State apparatus:\n\neven if the peasant suffered an exploitation as bad as or worse\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)473.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 451\n\nthan that of the Orient, the artisan and the merchant enjoyed a freer status\n\nand a more diversified market, prefiguring a middle class. Many metallur-\n\ngists and merchants from the Orient moved to the Aegean world, where\n\nthey were to find freer, more varied and more stable conditions. In short,  \n_the same flows that are overcoded in the Orient tend to become decoded in  \nEurope, _in a new situation that is like the flipside or correlate of the\nother.\n\nSurplus value is no longer surplus value of code (overcoding) but becomes\n\nsurplus value of flow. It is as if two solutions were found for the same prob-\n\nlem, the Oriental solution and then the Western one, which grafts itself\n\nupon the first and brings it out of the impasse while continuing to presup-\n\npose it. The European metallurgist and merchant faced a much less thor-\n\noughly coded international market, one not limited to an imperial house or\n\nclass. And as Childe said, the Western and Aegean States were immersed in\n\na supranational economic system from the start; they bathed in it, instead\n\nof containing it within the limits of their own net.\n\n42\n\nIt is indeed another pole of the State that arises, one that could be\n\ndefined in summary fashion as follows. The _public sphere _no longer charac-\n\nterizes the objective nature of property but is instead the shared means for\n\na now private appropriation; this yields the public-private mixes constitu-\n\ntive of the modern world. _The bond becomes personal; _personal relations of\n\ndependence, both between owners (contracts) and between owned and\n\nowners (conventions), parallel or replace community relations or relations\n\nbased on one's public function. Even slavery changes; it no longer defines\n\nthe public availability of the communal worker but rather private property\n\nas applied to individual workers.\n\n43\n\nThe _law _in its entirety undergoes a\n\nmutation, becoming subjective, conjunctive, \"topical\" law: this is because\n\nthe State apparatus is faced with a new task, which consists less in\n\novercoding already coded flows than in _organizing conjunctions of decoded  \nflows as such. _Thus the regime of signs has changed: in all of these\nrespects,\n\nthe operation of the imperial \"signifier\" has been superseded by _processes  \nof subjedification; _machinic enslavement tends to be replaced by a regime\n\nof _social subjection. _And unlike the relatively uniform imperial pole, this\n\nsecond pole presents the most diverse of forms. But as varied as relations of\n\npersonal dependence are, they always mark qualified and topical conjunc-\n\ntions. It was the evolved empires, of the East and of the West, that first\n\ndeveloped this new public sphere _of the _private, through institutions such\n\nas the _consilium _and the _fiscus _in the Roman Empire (it was through these\n\ninstitutions that freed slaves acquired a political power paralleling that of\n\nthe functionaries).\n\n44\n\nBut it was also the autonomous cities, the feudal sys-\n\ntems. ..

In a beautiful passage, Edgar Quinet underlines this coincidence\n\nbetween \"the delirium of the twelve Cesars and the golden age of Roman\n\nlaw.\"\n\n46\n\nThe subjectifications, conjunctions, and appropriations do not prevent\n\nthe decoded flows from continuing to flow, and from ceaselessly engender-\n\ning new flows that escape (we saw this, for example, at the level of a\n\nmicropolitics of the Middle Ages). This is where there is an ambiguity in\n\nthese apparatuses: they can only function with decoded flows, and yet they\n\ndo not let them stream together; they perform topical conjunctions that\n\nstand as so many knots or recodings. This accounts for the historians'\n\nimpression that capitalism \"could have\" developed beginning at a certain\n\nmoment, in China, in Rome, in Byzantium, in the Middle Ages, that the\n\nconditions for it existed but were not effectuated or even capable of being\n\neffectuated. The situation is that the pressure of the flows draws capitalism\n\nin negative outline, but for it to be realized there must be a whole _integral\nof  \ndecoded flows, _a whole _generalized conjunction _that overspills and over-\n\nturns the preceding apparatuses. And in fact when Marx sets about defin-\n\ning capitalism, he begins by invoking the advent of a single unqualified and\n\nglobal Subjectivity, which capitalizes all of the processes of\n\nsubjectifica-tion, \"all activities without distinction\": \"productive activity\n\nin general,\" \"the sole subjective essence of wealth . . .\" And this single\n\nSubject now expresses itself in an Object in general, no longer in this or\n\nthat qualitative state: \"Along with the abstract universality of\n\nwealth-creating activity we have now the universality of the object defined\n\nas wealth, viz. the product in general, or labor in general, but as past,\n\nmaterialized labor.\"\n\n47\n\nCirculation constitutes capital as a subjectivity\n\ncommensurate with society in its entirety. But this new social subjectivity\n\ncan form only to the extent that the decoded flows overspill their\n\nconjunctions and attain a level of decoding that the State apparatuses are\n\nno longer able to reclaim: _on the one hand, _the flow of labor must no\n\nlonger be determined as slavery or serfdom but must become naked and free\n\nlabor; and _on the other hand, _wealth must no longer be determined as\n\nmoney dealing, merchant's or landed wealth, but must become pure\n\nhomogeneous and independent capital.

But it\n\nis their abstract conjunction in a single stroke that constitutes capitalism,\n\nproviding a universal subject and an object in general for one another. Cap-\n\nitalism forms when the flow of unqualified wealth encounters the flow of\n\nunqualified labor and conjugates with it.\n\n48\n\nThis is what the preceding con-\n\njunctions, which were still topical or qualitative, had always inhibited (the\n\ntwo principal inhibitors were the feudal organization of the countryside\n\nand the corporative organization of the towns). This amounts to saying\n\nthat capitalism forms with _a general axiomatic of decoded flows. _\"Capital is\n\na right, or, to be more precise, a relation of production that is manifested\nas\n\na right, and as such it is independent of the concrete form that it cloaks at\n\neach moment of its productive function.\"\n\n49\n\nPrivate property no longer\n\nexpresses the bond of personal dependence but the independence of a Sub-\n\nject that now constitutes the sole bond. This makes for an important differ-\n\nence in the evolution of private property: private property in itself relates\n\nto rights, instead of the law relating it to the land, things, or people (this\n\nraises in particular the famous question of the elimination of ground rent\n\nin capitalism). _A new threshold of deterritorialization. _And when capital\n\nbecomes an active right in this way, the entire historical figure of the law\n\nchanges. The law ceases to be the overcoding of customs, as it was in the\n\narchaic empire; it is no longer a set of topics, as it was in the evolved\nStates,\n\nthe autonomous cities, and the feudal systems; it increasingly assumes the\n\ndirect form and immediate characteristics of an axiomatic, as evidenced in\n\nour civil \"code.\"\n\n50\n\nWhen the flows reach this capitalist threshold of decoding and deterri-\n\ntorialization (naked labor, independent capital), it seems that there is no\n\nlonger a need for a State, for distinct juridical and political domination, in\n\norder to ensure appropriation, which has become directly economic. The\n\neconomy constitutes a worldwide axiomatic, a \"universal cosmopolitan\n\nenergy which overflows every restriction and bond,\"\n\n51\n\na mobile and con-\n\nvertible substance \"such as the total value of annual production.\" Today we\n\ncan depict an enormous, so-called stateless, monetary mass that circulates\n\nthrough foreign exchange and across borders, eluding control by the States,\n\nforming a multinational ecumenical organization, constituting a de facto\n\nsupranational power untouched by governmental decisions.\n\n52\n\nBut what-\n\never dimensions or quantities this may have assumed today, capitalism has\n\nfrom the beginning mobilized a force of deterritorialization infinitely sur-\n\npassing the deterritorialization proper to the State. For since Paleolithic\n\nand Neolithic times, the State has been deterritorializing to the extent that\n\nit makes the earth an _object _of its higher unity, a forced aggregate of\ncoexis-\n\ntence, instead of the free play of territories among themselves and with the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)476.png)\n\n0\n\n454 D\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nlineages. But this is precisely the sense in which the State is termed \"terri-\n\ntorial.\" Capitalism, on the other hand, is not at all territorial, even in its\n\nbeginnings: its power of deterritorialization consists in taking as its\nobject,\n\nnot the earth, but \"materialized labor,\" the commodity. And private prop-\n\nerty is no longer ownership of the land or the soil, nor even of the means of\n\nproduction as such, but of convertible abstract rights.\n\n53\n\nThat is why capital-\n\nism marks a mutation in worldwide or ecumenical organizations, which\n\nnow take on a consistency of their own: the worldwide axiomatic, instead\n\nof resulting from heterogeneous social formations and their relations, for\n\nthe most part distributes these formations, determines their relations,\n\nwhile organizing an international division of labor. From all these stand-\n\npoints, it could be said that capitalism develops an economic order that\n\ncould do without the State. And in fact capitalism is not short on war cries\n\nagainst the State, not only in the name of the market, but by virtue of its\n\nsuperior deterritorialization.\n\nThis, however, is only one very partial aspect of capital. If it is true that\n\nwe are not using the word axiomatic as a simple metaphor, we must review\n\nwhat distinguishes an axiomatic from all manner of codes, overcodings,\n\nand recodings: the axiomatic deals directly with purely functional ele-\n\nments and relations whose nature is not specified, and which are immedi-\n\nately realized in highly varied domains simultaneously; codes, on the other\n\nhand, are relative to those domains and express specific relations between\n\nqualified elements that cannot be subsumed by a higher formal unity\n\n(overcoding) except by transcendence and in an indirect fashion. The  \n_immanent axiomatic _finds in the domains it moves through so many mod-\n\nels, termed _models of realization. _It could similarly be said that capital\nas\n\nright, as a \"qualitatively homogeneous and quantitatively commensurable\n\nelement,\" is realized in sectors and means of production (or that \"unified\n\ncapital\" is realized in \"differentiated capital\"). However, the different sec-\n\ntors are not alone in serving as models of realization\u2014_the States _do too.\n\nEach of them groups together and combines several sectors, according to\n\nits resources, population, wealth, industrial capacity, etc. Thus the States,\n\nin capitalism, are not canceled out but change form and take on a new\n\nmeaning: models of realization for a worldwide axiomatic that exceeds\n\nthem. But to exceed is not at all the same thing as doing without. We have\n\nalready seen that capitalism proceeds by way of the State-form rather than\n\nthe town-form; the basis for the fundamental mechanisms described by\n\nMarx (the colonial regime, the public debt, the modern tax system and\n\nindirect taxation, industrial protectionism, trade wars) may be laid in the\n\ntowns, but the towns function as mechanisms of accumulation, accelera-\n\ntion, and concentration only to the extent that they are appropriated by\n\nStates. Recent events tend to confirm this principle from another angle.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)477.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 455\n\nFor example, NASA appeared ready to mobilize considerable capital for  \ninterplanetary exploration, as though capitalism were riding a vector tak-  \ning it to the moon; but following the USSR, which conceived of extraterres-  \ntrial space as a belt that should circle the earth taken as the \"object,\" the  \nAmerican government cut off funds for exploration and returned capital in  \nthis case to a more centered model. It is thus proper to State  \ndeterrito-rialization to moderate the superior deterritorialization of capital  \nand to provide the latter with compensatory reterritorializations. More  \ngenerally, this extreme example aside, we must take into account a  \n\"materialist\" determination of the modern State or nation-state: a group of  \nproducers in which labor and capital circulate freely, in other words, in  \nwhich the homogeneity and competition of capital is effectuated, in  \nprinciple without external obstacles. In order to be effectuated, capitalism  \nhas always required there to be a new force and a new law of States, on the  \nlevel of the flow of labor as on the level of the flow of independent  \ncapital.\n\nSo States are not at all transcendent paradigms of an overcoding but\n\nimmanent models of realization for an axiomatic of decoded flows. Once  \nagain, our use of the word \"axiomatic\" is far from a metaphor; we find liter-  \nally the same theoretical problems that are posed by the models in an axio-  \nmatic repeated in relation to the State. For models of realization, though  \nvaried, are supposed to be _isomorphic _with regard to the axiomatic they  \neffectuate; however, this isomorphy, concrete variations considered,  \naccommodates itself to the greatest of formal differences. Moreover, a sin-  \ngle axiomatic seems capable of encompassing polymorphic models, not  \nonly when it is not yet \"saturated,\" but with those models as integral ele-  \nments of its saturation.\n\n54\n\nThese \"problems\" become singularly political\n\nwhen we think of modern States.\n\n1. Are not all modern States isomorphic in relation to the capitalist axi-\n\nomatic, to the point that the difference between democratic, totalitarian,  \nliberal, and tyrannical States depends only on concrete variables, and on  \nthe worldwide distribution of those variables, which always undergo even-  \ntual readjustments? Even the so-called socialist States are isomorphic, to  \nthe extent that there is _only one world market, _the capitalist one.\n\n2. Conversely, does not the world capitalist axiomatic tolerate a real\n\npolymorphy, or even a heteromorphy, of models, and for two reasons? On  \nthe one hand, capital as a general relation of production can very easily  \nintegrate concrete sectors or modes of production that are noncapitalist.  \nBut on the other hand, and this is the main point, the bureaucratic socialist  \nStates can themselves develop different modes of production that only  \nconjugate with capitalism to form a set whose \"power\" exceeds that of the  \naxiomatic itself (it will be necessary to try to determine the nature of this\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)478.png)\n\n0\n\n456 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\npower, why we so often think of it in apocalyptic terms, what conflicts it\n\nspawns, what slim chances it leaves us.. .)\u2022\n\n3\\. A typology of modern States is thus coupled with a metaeconomics:\n\nit would be inaccurate to treat all States as \"interchangeable\" (even\n\nisomorphy does not have that consequence), but it would be no less inac-\n\ncurate to privilege a certain form of the State (forgetting that polymorphy\n\nestablishes strict complementarities between the Western democracies\n\nand the colonial or neocolonial tyrannies that they install or support in\n\nother regions) or to equate the bureaucratic socialist States with the totali-\n\ntarian capitalist States (neglecting the fact that the axiomatic can encom-\n\npass a real heteromorphy from which the higher power of the aggregate\n\nderives, even if it is for the worse).\n\nWhat is called a nation-state, in the most diverse forms, is precisely the\n\nState as a model of realization. And the birth of nations implies many arti-\n\nfices: Not only are they constituted in an active struggle against the imper-\n\nial or evolved systems, the feudal systems, and the autonomous cities, but\n\nthey crush their own \"minorities,\" in other words, minoritarian phenom-\n\nena that could be termed \"nationalitarian,\" which work from within and if\n\nneed be turn to the old codes to find a greater degree of freedom. The con-\n\nstituents of the nation are a land and a people: the \"natal,\" which is not\nnec-\n\nessarily innate, and the \"popular,\" which is not necessarily pregiven. The\n\nproblem of the nation is aggravated in the two extreme cases of a land with-\n\nout a people and a people without a land. How can a people and a land be\n\nmade, in other words, a nation\u2014a refrain? The coldest and bloodiest\n\nmeans vie with upsurges of romanticism. The axiomatic is complex, and is\n\nnot without passions. The natal or the land, as we have seen elsewhere,\n\nimplies a certain deterritorialization of the territories (community land,\n\nimperial provinces, seigneurial domains, etc.), and the people, a decoding\n\nof the population. The nation is constituted on the basis of these flows and\n\nis inseparable from the modern State that gives consistency to the corre-\n\nsponding land and people. It is the flow of naked labor that makes the peo-\n\nple, just as it is the flow of Capital that makes the land and its industrial\n\nbase. In short, the nation is the very operation of a collective\n\nsubjecti-fication, to which the modern State corresponds as a process of\n\nsubjection. It is in the form of the nation-state, with all its possible\n\nvariations, that the State becomes the model of realization for the capitalist\n\naxiomatic. This is not at all to say that nations are appearances or\n\nideological phenomena; on the contrary, they are the passional and living\n\nforms in which the qualitative homogeneity and the quantitative\n\ncompetition of abstract capital are first realized.\n\nWe distinguish _machinic enslavement _and _social subjection _as two sepa-\n\nrate concepts. There is enslavement when human beings themselves are\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)479.png)\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 457\n\nconstituent pieces of a machine that they compose among themselves and\n\nwith other things (animals, tools), under the control and direction of a\n\nhigher unity. But there is subjection when the higher unity constitutes the\n\nhuman being as a subject linked to a now exterior object, which can be an\n\nanimal, a tool, or even a machine. The human being is no longer a compo-\n\nnent of the machine but a worker, a user. He or she is subjected _to _the\n\nmachine and no longer enslaved _by _the machine. This is not to say that the\n\nsecond regime is more human. But the first regime does seem to have a spe-\n\ncial relation to the archaic imperial formation: human beings are not sub-\n\njects but pieces of a machine that overcodes the aggregate (this has been\n\ncalled \"generalized slavery,\" as opposed to the private slavery of antiquity,\n\nor feudal serfdom). We believe that Lewis Mumford is right in designating\n\nthe archaic empires megamachines, and in pointing out that, once again, it\n\nis not a question of a metaphor: \"If a machine can be defined more or less in\n\naccord with the classic definition of Reuleaux, as a combination of resist-\n\nant parts, each specialized in function, operating under human control to\n\ntransmit motion and to perform work, then the _human machine _was a real\n\nmachine.\"\n\n55\n\nOf course, it was the modern State and capitalism that brought\n\nthe triumph of machines, in particular of motorized machines (whereas\n\nthe archaic State had simple machines at best); but what we are referring to\n\nnow are _technical machines, _which are definable extrinsically. One is not\n\nenslaved by the technical machine but rather subjected to it. It would\n\nappear, then, that the modern State, through technological development,\n\nhas substituted an increasingly powerful social subjection for machinic\n\nenslavement. Ancient slavery and feudal serfdom were already procedures\n\nof subjection. But the naked or \"free\" worker of capitalism takes subjection\n\nto its most radical expression, since the processes of subjectification no\n\nlonger even enter into partial conjunctions that interrupt the flow. In\n\neffect, capital acts as the point of subjectification that constitutes all\n\nhuman beings as subjects; but some, the \"capitalists,\" are subjects of enun-\n\nciation that form the private subjectivity of capital, while the others, the\n\n\"proletarians,\" are subjects of the statement, subjected to the technical\n\nmachines in which constant capital is effectuated. The wage regime can\n\ntherefore take the subjection of human beings to an unprecedented point,\n\nand exhibit a singular cruelty, yet still be justified in its humanist cry:\nNo,\n\nhuman beings are not machines, we don't treat them like machines, we cer-\n\ntainly don't confuse variable capital and constant capital.. .\n\nCapitalism arises as a worldwide enterprise of subjectification by con-\n\nstituting an axiomatic of decoded flows. Social subjection, as the correlate\n\nof subjectification, appears much more in the axiomatic's models of real-\n\nization than in the axiomatic itself. It is within the framework of the\n\nnation-State, or of national subjectivities, that processes of subjectifica-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)480.png)\n\n0\n\n458 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\ntion and the corresponding subjections are manifested. The axiomatic\n\nitself, of which the States are models of realization, restores or reinvents,\nin\n\nnew and now technical forms, an entire system of machinic enslavement.\n\nThis in no way represents a return to the imperial machine since we are now\n\nin the immanence of an axiomatic, and not under the transcendence of a\n\nformal Unity. But it is the reinvention of a machine of which human beings\n\nare constituent parts, instead of subjected workers or users. If motorized\n\nmachines constituted the second age of the technical machine, cybernetic\n\nand informational machines form a third age that reconstructs a gener-\n\nalized regime of subjection: recurrent and reversible \"humans-machines\n\nsystems\" replace the old nonrecurrent and nonreversible relations of sub-\n\njection between the two elements; the relation between human and\n\nmachine is based on internal, mutual communication, and no longer on\n\nusage or action.\n\n56\n\nIn the organic composition of capital, variable capital\n\ndefines a regime of subjection of the worker (human surplus value), the\n\nprincipal framework of which is the business or factory. But with automa-\n\ntion comes a progressive increase in the proportion of constant capital; we\n\nthen see a new kind of enslavement: at the same time the work regime\n\nchanges, surplus value becomes machinic, and the framework expands to\n\nall of society. It could also be said that a small amount of subjectification\n\ntook us away from machinic enslavement, but a large amount brings us\n\nback to it. Attention has recently been focused on the fact that modern\n\npower is not at all reducible to the classical alternative \"repression or\nideol-\n\nogy\" but implies processes of normalization, modulation, modeling, and\n\ninformation that bear on language, perception, desire, movement, etc.,\n\nand which proceed by way of microassemblages. This aggregate includes\n\nboth subjection and enslavement taken to extremes, as two simultaneous\n\nparts that constantly reinforce and nourish each other.

Social subjection proportions itself to the model of realization, just\nas\n\nmachinic enslavement expands to meet the dimensions of the axiomatic\n\nthat is effectuated in the model. We have the privilege of undergoing the\n\ntwo operations simultaneously, in relation to the same things and the same\n\nevents. Rather than stages, subjection and enslavement constitute two\n\ncoexistent poles.\n\nWe may return to the different forms of the State, from the standpoint of\n\na universal history. We distinguish three major forms: (1) imperial archaic\n\nStates, which are paradigms and constitute a machine of enslavement by\n\novercoding already-coded flows (these States have little diversity, due to a\n\ncertain formal immutability that applies to all of them); (2) extremely\n\ndiverse States\u2014evolved empires, autonomous cities, feudal systems,\n\nmonarchies\u2014which proceed instead by subjectification and subjection,\n\nand constitute qualified or topical conjunctions of decoded flows; 3) the\n\nmodern nation-States, which take decoding even further and are models of\n\nrealization for an axiomatic or a general conjugation of flows (these States\n\ncombine social subjection and the new machinic enslavement, and their\n\nvery diversity is a function of isomorphy, of the eventual heteromorphy or\n\npolymorphy of the models in relation to the axiomatic).\n\nThere are, of course, all kinds of external circumstances that mark pro-\n\nfound breaks between these types of States, and above all submit the\n\narchaic empires to utter oblivion, a shrouding lifted only by archaeology.\n\nThe empires disappeared suddenly, as though in an instantaneous catas-\n\ntrophe. As in the Dorian invasion, a war machine looms up and bears down\n\nfrom without, killing memory. Yet things proceed quite differently on the\n\ninside, where all the States resonate together, appropriate armies for them-\n\nselves, and exhibit a unity of composition in spite of their differences in\n\norganization and development. It is evident that all decoded flows, of\n\nwhatever kind, are prone to forming a war machine directed against the\n\nState. But everything changes depending on whether these flows connect\n\nup with a war machine or, on the contrary, enter into conjunctions or a gen-\n\neral conjugation that appropriates them for the State. From this stand-\n\npoint, the modern States have a kind of transspatiotemporal unity with the\n\narchaic State. The internal correlation between 1 and 2 appears most\n\nclearly in the fact that the fragmented forms of the Aegean world presup-\n\npose the great imperial form of the Orient and find in it a stock or agricul-\n\ntural surplus, which they consequently have no need to produce or\n\naccumulate for themselves.

We find the revival of this\n\nform in the Greek, Roman, and feudal worlds: there is always an empire on\n\nthe horizon, which for the subjective States plays the role of signifier and\n\nencompassing element. And the correlation between 2 and 3 is no less pro-\n\nnounced, for industrial revolutions are not wanting, and the difference\n\nbetween topical conjunctions and the great conjugation of decoded flows is\n\nso thin that one is left with the impression that capitalism was continually\n\nbeing born, disappearing and reviving at every crossroads of history. And\n\nthe correlation between 3 and 1 is also a necessary one: the modern States\n\nof the third age do indeed restore the most absolute of empires, a new\n\n\"megamachine,\" whatever the novelty or timeliness of its now immanent\n\nform; they do this by realizing an axiomatic that functions as much by\n\nmachinic enslavement as by social subjection. Capitalism has reawakened\n\nthe _Urstaat, _and given it new strength.\n\n58\n\nNot only, as Hegel said, does every State imply \"the essential moments\n\nof its existence as a State,\" but there is a unique moment, in the sense of a\n\ncoupling of forces, and this moment of the State is capture, bond, knot,  \n_nexum, _magical capture. Must we speak of a second pole, which would\n\noperate instead by pact and contract? Is this not instead that other force,\n\nwith capture as the unique moment of coupling? For the two forces are the\n\novercoding of coded flows, and the treatment of decoded flows. The con-\n\ntract is a juridical expression of the second aspect: it appears as the pro-\n\nceeding of subjectification, the outcome of which is subjection. And the\n\ncontract must be pushed to the extreme; in other words, it is no longer con-\n\ncluded between two people but between self and self, within the same\n\nperson\u2014_Ich = Ich_\u2014as subjected and sovereign.

The State is assuredly not the locus of liberty, nor the agent of\n\na forced servitude or war capture. Should we then speak of \"voluntary ser-\n\nvitude\"? This is like the expression \"magical capture\": its only merit is to\n\nunderline the apparent mystery. There is a machinic enslavement, about\n\nwhich it could be said in each case that it presupposes itself, that it\nappears\n\nas preaccomplished; this machinic enslavement is no more \"voluntary\"\n\nthan it is \"forced.\"\n\nP\n\nROPOSITION\n\nXIV. _Axiomatics and the presentday situation._\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)483.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 461\n\nPolitics is by no means an apodictic science. It proceeds by experimen-\n\ntation, groping in the dark, injection, withdrawal, advances, retreats. The\n\nfactors of decision and prediction are limited. It is an absurdity to postu-\n\nlate a world supergovernment that makes the final decisions. No one is\n\neven capable of predicting the growth in the money supply. Similarly, the\n\nStates are affected by all kinds of coefficients of uncertainty and unpredict-\n\nability. John Kenneth Galbraith and Francois Chatelet have formulated\n\nthe concept of constant and decisive errors, which make the glory of men of\n\nState no less than their rare successful evaluations. But that is just one\n\nmore reason to make a connection between politics and axiomatics. For in\n\nscience an axiomatic is not at all a transcendent, autonomous, and\n\ndecision-making power opposed to experimentation and intuition. On the\n\none hand, it has its own gropings in the dark, experimentations, modes of\n\nintuition. Axioms being independent of each other, can they be added, and\n\nup to what point (a saturated system)? Can they be withdrawn (a \"weak-\n\nened\" system)? On the other hand, it is of the nature of axiomatics to come\n\nup against _so-called undecidable propositions, _to confront _necessarily  \nhigher powers _that it cannot master.\n\n60\n\nFinally, axiomatics does not consti-\n\ntute the cutting edge of science; it is much more a stopping point, a reorder-\n\ning that prevents decoded semiotic flows in physics and mathematics from\n\nescaping in all directions. The great axiomaticians are the men of State of\n\nscience, who seal off the lines of flight that are so frequent in mathematics,\n\nwho would impose a new _nexum, _if only a temporary one, and who lay\n\ndown the official policies of science. They are the heirs of the theorematic\n\nconception of geometry. When intuitionism opposed axiomatics, it was\n\nnot only in the name of intuition, of construction and creation, but also in\n\nthe name of a calculus of problems, a problematic conception of science\n\nthat was not less abstract but implied an entirely different abstract\n\nmachine, one working in the undecidable and the fugitive.\n\n61\n\nIt is the real\n\ncharacteristics of axiomatics that lead us to say that capitalism and pres-\n\nent-day politics are an axiomatic in the literal sense. But it is precisely\nfor\n\nthis reason that nothing is played out in advance. From this standpoint, we\n\nmay present a summary sketch of the \"givens.\"\n\n1. _Addition, subtraction. _The axioms of capitalism are obviously not\n\ntheoretical propositions, or ideological formulas, but operative statements\n\nthat constitute the semiological form of Capital and that enter as compo-\n\nnent parts into assemblages of production, circulation, and consumption.\n\nThe axioms are primary statements, which do not derive from or depend\n\nupon another statement.

There is a tendency within capitalism continually to add more axi-\n\noms. After the end of World War I, the joint influence of the world depres-\n\nsion and the Russian Revolution forced capitalism to multiply its axioms,\n\nto invent new ones dealing with the working class, employment, union\n\norganization, social institutions, the role of the State, the foreign and\n\ndomestic markets. Keynesian economics and the New Deal were axiom\n\nlaboratories. Examples of the creation of new axioms after the Second\n\nWorld War: the Marshall Plan, forms of assistance and lending, transfor-\n\nmations in the monetary system. It is not only in periods of expansion or\n\nrecovery that axioms multiply. What makes the axiomatic vary, in relation\n\nto the States, is the distinction and relation between the foreign and domes-\n\ntic markets. There is a multiplication of axioms most notably when an inte-\n\ngrated domestic market is being organized to meet the requirements of the\n\nforeign market. Axioms for the young, for the old, for women, etc. A very\n\ngeneral pole of the State, \"social democracy,\" can be defined by this ten-\n\ndency to add, invent axioms in relation to spheres of investment and\n\nsources of profit: the question is not that of freedom and constraint, nor of\n\ncentralism and decentralization, but of the manner in which one masters\n\nthe flows. In this case, they are mastered by the multiplication of directing\n\naxioms. The opposite tendency is no less a part of capitalism: the tendency\n\nto withdraw, subtract axioms. One falls back on a very small number of axi-\n\noms regulating the dominant flows, while the other flows are given a deriv-\n\native, consequential status (defined by the \"theorems\" ensuing from the\n\naxioms), or are left in an untamed state that does not preclude the brutal\n\nintervention of State power, quite the contrary. The \"totalitarianism\" pole\n\nof the State incarnates this tendency to restrict the number of axioms, and\n\noperates by the exclusive promotion of the foreign sector: the appeal to for-\n\neign sources of capital, the rise of industries aimed at the exportation of\n\nfoodstuffs or raw materials, the collapse of the domestic market. The totali-\n\ntarian State iS not a maximum State but rather, following Virilio's formula-\n\ntion, the _minimum State of _anarcho-capitalism (cf. Chile). At the limit, the\n\nonly axioms that are retained concern the equilibrium of the foreign sector,\n\nreserve levels and the inflation rate; \"the population is no longer a given,\nit\n\nhas become a consequence.\" As for untamed evolutions, they appear\n\namong other places in the variations in the employment level, in the phe-\n\nnomena of exodus from the countryside, shantytown-urbanization, etc.\n\nThe case of fascism (\"national socialism\") is distinct from totalitarian-\n\nism. It coincides with the totalitarian pole in the collapse of the domestic\n\nmarket and the reduction in the number of axioms. However, the promo-\n\ntion of the foreign sector does not at all take place through an appeal to\nfor-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)485.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE D 463\n\neign sources of capital and through export industries, but through a war\n\neconomy, which entails an expansionism foreign to totalitarianism and an\n\nautonomous fabrication of capital. As for the domestic market, it is effec-\n\ntuated in a specific production of the _Ersatz. _This means that fascism, too,\n\nbrings a proliferation of axioms, which explains why it has often been com-\n\npared to a Keynesian economy. Fascism, however, is a tautological or ficti-\n\ntious proliferation, a multiplication by subtraction; this makes it a very\n\nspecial case.\n\n62\n\n_2\\. Saturation. _Can we express the distribution of the two opposite ten-\n\ndencies by saying that the saturation of the system marks the point of inver-\n\nsion? No, for the saturation is itself relative. If Marx demonstrated the\n\nfunctioning of capitalism as an axiomatic, it was above all in the famous\n\nchapter on the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Capitalism is indeed an\n\naxiomatic, because it has no laws but immanent ones. It would like for us to\n\nbelieve that it confronts the limits of the Universe, the extreme limit of\n\nresources and energy. But all it confronts are its own limits (the periodic\n\ndepreciation of existing capital); all it repels or displaces are its own\nlimits\n\n(the formation of new capital, in new industries with a high profit rate).\n\nThis is the history of oil and nuclear power. And it does both at once: capi-\n\ntalism confronts its own limits and simultaneously displaces them, setting\n\nthem down again farther along. It could be said that the totalitarian ten-\n\ndency to restrict the number of axioms corresponds to the confrontation\n\nwith the limits, whereas the social democratic tendency corresponds to the\n\ndisplacement of the limits. But one does not come without the other, either\n\nin two different but coexistent places or in two successive but closely linked\n\nmoments; they always have a hold on each other, or are even contained in\n\neach other, constituting the same axiomatic. A typical example would be\n\npresent-day Brazil, with its ambiguous alternative \"totalitarianism-social\n\ndemocracy.\" As a general rule, the limits are all the more mobile if axioms\n\nare subtracted in one place but added elsewhere.\n\nIt would be an error to take a disinterested stance toward struggle on the\n\nlevel of the axioms. It is sometimes thought that every axiom, in capitalism\n\nor in one of its States, constitutes a \"recuperation.\" But this disenchanted\n\nconcept is not a good one. The constant readjustments of the capitalist axi-\n\nomatic, in other words, the additions (the enunciation of new axioms) and\n\nthe withdrawals (the creation of exclusive axioms), are the object of strug-\n\ngles in no way confined to the technocracy. Everywhere, the workers' strug-\n\ngles overspill the framework of the capitalist enterprises, which imply for\n\nthe most part derivative propositions. The struggles bear directly upon the\n\naxioms that presi de over the State's public spending, or that even concern a\n\nspecific international organization (for example, a multinational corpora-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)486.png)\n\n0\n\n464 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\ntion can at will plan the liquidation of a factory inside a country). The\n\nresulting danger of a worldwide labor bureaucracy or technocracy taking\n\ncharge of these problems can be warded off only to the extent that local\n\nstruggles directly target national and international axioms, at the precise\n\npoint of their insertion in the field of immanence (the potential of the rural\n\nworld in this respect). There is always a fundamental difference between\n\nliving flows and the axioms that subordinate them to centers of control and\n\ndecision making, that make a given segment correspond to them, which\n\nmeasure their quanta. But the pressure of the living flows, and of the prob-\n\nlems they pose and impose, must be exerted inside the axiomatic, as much\n\nin order to fight the totalitarian reductions as to anticipate and precipitate\n\nthe additions, to orient them and prevent their technocratic perversion.\n\n3. _Models, isomorphy. _In principle, all States are isomorphic; in other\n\nwords, they are domains of realization of capital as a function of a sole\n\nexternal world market. But the first question is whether isomorphy implies\n\na homogeneity or even a homogenization of States. The answer is yes, as\n\ncan be seen in present-day Europe with respect to justice and the police, the\n\nhighway code, the circulation of commodities, production costs, etc. But\n\nthis is true only insofar as there is a tendency toward a single integrated\n\ndomestic market. Otherwise, isomorphy in no way implies homogeneity:\n\nthere is isomorphy, but heterogeneity, between totalitarian and social dem-\n\nocratic States wherever the mode of production is the same. The general\n\nrules regarding this are as follows: the consistency, _the totality\n{Vensemble),  \nor unity of the axiomatic _are defined by capital as a \"right\" or relation of\n\nproduction (for the market); _the respective independence of the axioms _in\n\nno way contradicts this totality but derives from the divisions or sectors of\n\nthe capitalist mode of production; _the isomorphy of the models, _with the\n\ntwo poles of addition and subtraction, depends on how the domestic and\n\nforeign markets are distributed in each case.\n\nBut this is only a first bipolarity, applying to the States that are located\n\nat the center and are under the capitalist mode of production. A second,\n\nWest-East, bipolarity has been imposed on the States of the center, that of\n\nthe capitalist States and the bureaucratic socialist States. Although this\n\nnew distinction may share certain traits of the first (the so-called socialist\n\nStates being assimilable to the totalitarian States), the problem lies else-\n\nwhere. The numerous \"convergence\" theories that attempt to demonstrate\n\na certain homogenization of the States of the East and West are not very\n\nconvincing. Even isomorphism is not applicable: there is a real\n\nheteromorphy, not only because the mode of production is not capitalist,\n\nbut also because the relation of production is not Capital (rather, it is the\n\nPlan). If the socialist States are nevertheless still models of realization\nfor\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)487.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 465\n\nthe capitalist axiomatic, it is due to the existence of a single external\n\nworld market, which remains the deciding factor here, even above and\n\nbeyond the relations of production from which it results. It can even hap-\n\npen that the _socialist bureaucraticplan(e) _takes on a parasitic function in\n\nrelation to the _plan(e) of capital, _which manifests a greater creativity, of\n\nthe \"virus\" type.\n\nFinally, the third fundamental bipolarity is the center and the periphery\n\n(North-South). In view of the respective independence of the axioms, we\n\ncan join Samir Amin in saying that the axioms of the periphery differ from\n\nthose of the center.\n\n63\n\nAnd here again, the difference and independence of\n\nthe axioms in no way compromise the consistency of the overall axiomatic.\n\nOn the contrary, central capitalism needs the periphery constituted by the\n\nThird World, where it locates a large part of its most modern industries; it\n\ndoes not just invest capital in these industries, but is also furnished with\n\ncapital by them. The issue of the dependence of the Third World States is of\n\ncourse an obvious one, but not the most important one (it was bequeathed\n\nby the old colonialism). It is obvious that having independent axioms has\n\nnever guaranteed the independence of States; rather it ensures an interna-\n\ntional division of labor. The important question, once again, is that of\n\nisomorphy in relation to the worldwide axiomatic. To a large extent, there\n\nis isomorphy between the United States and the bloodiest of the South\n\nAmerican tyrannies (or between France, England, and West Germany and\n\ncertain African States). The center-periphery bipolarity, States of the cen-\n\nter and States of the Third World, may well exhibit some of the distinguish-\n\ning traits of the two preceding bipolarities, but it also evades them, raising\n\nother problems. Throughout a vast portion of the Third World, the general\n\nrelation of production is capital\u2014even throughout the entire Third World,\n\nin the sense that the socialized sector may utilize that relation, adopting it\n\nin this case. But the mode of production is not necessarily capitalist, either\n\nin the so-called archaic or transitional forms, or in the most productive,\n\nhighly industrialized sectors. This indeed represents a third case, included\n\nin the worldwide axiomatic: when capital acts as the relation of production\n\nbut in noncapitalist modes of production. We may therefore speak of a\n\npolymorphy of the Third World States in relation to the States of the center.\n\nAnd this dimension of the axiomatic is no less necessary than the others; it\n\nis even much more necessary, for the heteromorphy of the so-called social-\n\nist States was imposed upon capitalism, which digested it as best it could,\n\nwhereas the polymorphy of the Third World States is partially organized\n\nby the center, as an axiom providing a substitute for colonization.\n\nWe are always brought back to the literal question of the models of real-\n\nization of a worldwide axiomatic: there is in principle an _isomorphy _of the\n\nStates of the center, a _heteromorphy _imposed by the bureaucratic socialist\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)488.png)\n\n0\n\n466 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nState, and a _polymorphy _organized by the Third World States. Once again,\n\nit would be absurd to think that the insertion of popular movements is con-\n\ndemned in advance throughout this field of immanence, and to assume\n\nthat there are either \"good\" States that are democratic, social democratic\n\nor at the other extreme socialist, or that on the contrary all States are\nequiv-\n\nalent and homogeneous.\n\n4. _Power (puissance). _Let us suppose that the axiomatic necessarily mar-\n\nshals a power higher than the one it treats, in other words, than that of the\n\naggregates serving as its models. This is like a power of the continuum, tied\n\nto the axiomatic but exceeding it. We immediately recognize this power as\n\na power of destruction, of war, a power incarnated in financial, industrial,\n\nand military technological complexes that are in continuity with one\n\nanother. On the one hand, war clearly follows the same movement as capi-\n\ntalism: In the same way as the proportion of constant capital keeps grow-\n\ning, war becomes increasingly a \"war of materiel\" in which the human\n\nbeing no longer even represents a variable capital of subjection, but is\n\ninstead a pure element of machinic enslavement. On the other hand, and\n\nthis is the main point, the growing importance of constant capital in the\n\naxiomatic means that the depreciation of existing capital and the forma-\n\ntion of new capital assume a rhythm and scale that necessarily take the\n\nroute of a war machine now incarnated in the complexes: the complexes\n\nactively contribute to the redistributions of the world necessary for the\n\nexploitation of maritime and planetary resources. There is a continuous\n\n\"threshold\" of power that accompanies in every instance the shifting of the\n\naxiomatic's limits; it is as though the power of war always supersaturated\n\nthe system's saturation, and was its necessary condition.\n\nThe classical conflicts among the States of the center (as well as periph-\n\neral colonization) have been joined, or rather replaced, by two great\n\nconflictual lines, between West and East and North and South; these lines\n\nintersect and together cover everything. But the overarmament of the West\n\nand East not only leaves the reality of local wars entirely intact and gives\n\nthem a new force and new stakes; it not only founds the \"apocalyptic\" pos-\n\nsibility of a direct confrontation along the two great axes; it also seems\nthat\n\nthe war machine takes on a specific supplementary meaning: industrial,\n\npolitical, judicial, etc. It is indeed true that the States, throughout their\nhis-\n\ntory, have repeatedly appropriated the war machine; and it was after the\n\nwar machine was appropriated that war, its preparation and effectuation,\n\nbecame the exclusive object of the machine, but as a more or less \"limited\"\n\nwar. As for the aim, it remained the political aim of the States. The various\n\nfactors that tended to make war a \"total war,\" most notably the fascist fac-\n\ntor, marked the beginning of an inversion of the movement: as though the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)489.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 467\n\nStates, through the war they waged against one another, had after a long  \nperiod of appropriation reconstituted an autonomous war machine. But  \nthis unchained or liberated war machine continued to have as its object war  \nin action, a now total, unlimited kind of war. The entire fascist economy  \nbecame a war economy, but the war economy still needed total war as its  \nobject. For this reason, fascist war still fell under Clausewitz's formula,  \n\"the continuation of politics by other means,\" even though those other  \nmeans had become exclusive, in other words, the political aim had entered  \ninto contradiction with the object (hence Virilio's idea that the fascist\nState  \nwas a \"suicidal\" State more than a totalitarian one). It was only after World  \nWar II that the automatization, then automation of the war machine had  \ntheir true effect. The war machine, the new antagonisms traversing it con-  \nsidered, no longer had war as its exclusive object but took in charge and as  \nits object peace, politics, the world order, in short, the aim. This is where  \nthe inversion of Clausewitz's formula comes in: it is politics that becomes  \nthe continuation of war; // _is peace that technologically frees the unlimited  \nmaterial process of total war. _War ceases to be the materialization of the\nwar  \nmachine; _the war machine itself becomes materialized war. _In this sense,  \nthere was no longer a need for fascism. The Fascists were only child precur-  \nsors, and the absolute peace of survival succeeded where total war had  \nfailed. The Third World War was already upon us. The war machine  \nreigned over the entire axiomatic like the power of the continuum that sur-  \nrounded the \"world-economy,\" and it put all the parts of the universe in  \ncontact. The world became a smooth space again (sea, air, atmosphere),  \nover which reigned a single war machine, even when it opposed its own  \nparts. Wars had become a part of peace. More than that, the States no  \nlonger appropriated the war machine; they reconstituted a war machine of  \nwhich they themselves were only the parts.\n\nOf all the authors who have developed an apocalyptic or millenarian\n\nsense, it is to Paul Virilio's credit to have emphasized these five rigorous  \npoints: that the war machine finds its new object in the absolute peace of  \nterror or deterrence; that it performs a technoscientific \"capitalization\";  \nthat this war machine is terrifying not as a function of a possible war that  \nit promises us, as by blackmail, but, on the contrary, as a function of the  \nreal, very special kind of peace it promotes and has already installed; that  \nthis war machine no longer needs a qualified enemy but, in conformity  \nwith the requirements of an axiomatic, operates against the \"unspecified  \nenemy,\" domestic or foreign (an individual, group, class, people, event,  \nworld); that there arose from this a new conception of security as materia-  \nlized war, as organized insecurity or molecularized, distributed, pro-  \ngrammed catastrophe.\n\n64\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)490.png)\n\n0\n\n468 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\n5. _The included middle. _No one has demonstrated more convincingly\n\nthan Braudel that the capitalist axiomatic requires a center and that this\n\ncenter was constituted in the North, at the outcome of a long historical\n\nprocess: \"There can only be a world-economy when the mesh of the net-\n\nwork is sufficiently fine, and when exchange is regular and voluminous\n\nenough to give rise to a central zone.\"\n\n65\n\nMany authors believe on this\n\naccount that the North-South, center-periphery axis is more important\n\ntoday than the West-East axis, and even principally determines it. This is\n\nexpressed in a common thesis, taken up and developed by Valery Giscard\n\nd'Estaing: the more equilibrated things become at the center between the\n\nWest and the East, beginning with the equilibrium of overarmament, the\n\nmore they become disequilibrated or \"destabilized\" from North to South\n\nand destabilize the central equilibrium. It is clear that in these formulas\nthe\n\nSouth is an abstract term designating the Third World or the periphery;\n\nand even that there are Souths or Third Worlds inside the center. It is also\n\nclear that this destabilization is not accidental but is a (theorematic)\nconse-\n\nquence of the axioms of capitalism, principally of the axiom called _unequal  \nexchange, _which is indispensable to capitalism's functioning. This for-\n\nmula is therefore the modern version of the oldest formula, which already\n\nobtained in the archaic empires under different conditions. The more the\n\narchaic empire overcoded the flows, the more it stimulated decoded flows\n\nthat turned back against it and forced it to change. The more the decoded\n\nflows enter into a central axiomatic, the more they tend to escape to the\n\nperiphery, to present problems that the axiomatic is incapable of resolving\n\nor controlling (even by adding special axioms for the periphery).\n\nThe four principal flows that torment the representatives of the world\n\neconomy, or of the axiomatic, are the flow of matter-energy, the flow of\n\npopulation, the flow of food, and the urban flow. The situation seems inex-\n\ntricable because the axiomatic never ceases to create all of these problems,\n\nwhile at the same time its axioms, even multiplied, deny it the means of\n\nresolving them (for example, the circulation and distribution that would\n\nmake it possible to feed the world). Even a social democracy adapted to the\n\nThird World surely does not undertake to integrate the whole\n\npoverty-stricken population into the domestic market; what it does,\n\nrather, is to effect the class rupture that will select the integratable\n\nelements. And the States of the center deal not only with the Third\n\nWorld, each of them has not only an external Third World, but there are\n\ninternal Third Worlds that rise up within them and work them from the\n\ninside. It could even be said in certain respects that the periphery and the\n\ncenter exchange determinations: a deterritorialization of the center, a\n\ndecoding of the center in relation to national and territorial aggregates,\n\ncause the peripheral formations to become true centers of investment,\n\nwhile the central formations\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)491.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 469\n\nperipheralize. This simultaneously strengthens and relativizes Samir\n\nAmin's theses. The more the worldwide axiomatic installs high industry\n\nand highly industrialized agriculture at the periphery, provisionally\n\nreserving for the center so-called postindustrial activities (automation,\n\nelectronics, information technologies, the conquest of space,\n\noverarma-ment, etc.), the more it installs peripheral zones of\n\nunderdevelopment inside the center, internal Third Worlds, internal\n\nSouths. \"Masses\" of the population are abandoned to erratic work\n\n(subcontracting, temporary work, or work in the underground economy),\n\nand their official subsistence is assured only by State allocations and\n\nwages subject to interruption. It is to the credit of thinkers like Antonio\n\nNegri to have formulated, on the basis of the exemplary case of Italy, the\n\ntheory of this internal margin, which tends increasingly to merge the\n\nstudents with the _emarginati._\n\n_66_\n\n_ _These phenomena confirm the difference\n\nbetween the new machinic enslavement and classical subjection. For\n\nsubjection remained centered on labor and involved a bipolar\n\norganization, property-labor, bourgeoisie-proletariat. In enslavement and\n\nthe central dominance of constant capital, on the other hand, labor seems\n\nto have splintered in two directions: intensive surplus labor that no longer\n\neven takes the route of labor, and extensive labor that has become erratic\n\nand floating. The totalitarian tendency to abandon axioms of employment\n\nand the social democratic tendency to multiply statutes can combine\n\nhere, but always in order to effect class ruptures. The opposition between\n\nthe axiomatic and the flows it does not succeed in mastering becomes all\n\nthe more accentuated.\n\n6. _Minorities. _Ours is becoming the age of minorities. We have seen sev-\n\neral times that minorities are not necessarily defined by the smallness of\n\ntheir numbers but rather by becoming or a line of fluctuation, in other\n\nwords, by the gap that separates them from this or that axiom constituting a\n\nredundant majority (\"Ulysses, or today's average, urban European\"; or as\n\nYann Moulier says, \"the national Worker, qualified, male and over\n\nthirty-five\"). A minority can be small in number; but it can also be the\n\nlargest in number, constitute an absolute, indefinite majority. That is the\n\nsituation when authors, even those supposedly on the Left, repeat the great\n\ncapitalist warning cry: in twenty years, \"whites\" will form only 12\n\npercent of the world population. . . Thus they are not content to say that the\n\nmajority will change, or has already changed, but say that it is impinged\n\nupon by a nondenumerable and proliferating minority that threatens to\n\ndestroy the very concept of majority, in other words, the majority as an\n\naxiom. And the curious concept of nonwhite does not in fact constitute a\n\ndenumerable set. What defines a minority, then, is not the number but the\n\nrelations internal to the number. A minority can be numerous, or even\n\ninfinite; so can a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)492.png)\n\n0\n\n470 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nmajority. What distinguishes them is that in the case of a majority the rela-\n\ntion internal to the number constitutes a set that may be finite or infinite,\n\nbut is always denumerable, whereas the minority is defined as a non-\n\ndenumerable set, however many elements it may have. What characterizes\n\nthe nondenumerable is neither the set nor its elements; rather, it is the\n_con-  \nnection, _the \"and\" produced between elements, between sets, and which\n\nbelongs to neither, which eludes them and constitutes a line of flight. The\n\naxiomatic manipulates only denumerable sets, even infinite ones, whereas\n\nthe minorities constitute \"fuzzy,\" nondenumerable, nonaxiomizable sets,\n\nin short, \"masses,\" multiplicities of escape and flux.\n\nWhether it be the infinite set of the nonwhites of the periphery, or the\n\nrestricted set of the Basques, Corsicans, etc., everywhere we look we see the\n\nconditions for a worldwide movement: the minorities recreate\n\n\"nationali-tarian\" phenomena that the nation-states had been charged with\n\ncontrolling and quashing. The bureaucratic socialist sector is certainly not\n\nspared by these movements, and as Amalrik said, the dissidents are\n\nnothing, or serve only as pawns in international politics, if they are\n\nabstracted from the minorities working the USSR. It matters little that the\n\nminorities are incapable of constituting viable States from the point of\n\nview of the axiomatic and the market, since in the long run they promote\n\ncompositions that do not pass by way of the capitalist economy any more\n\nthan they do the State-form. The response of the States, or of the axiomatic,\n\nmay obviously be to accord the minorities regional or federal or statutory\n\nautonomy, in short, to add axioms. But this is not the problem: this\n\noperation consists only in translating the minorities into denumerable sets\n\nor subsets, which would enter as elements into the majority, which could\n\nbe counted among the majority. The same applies for a status accorded to\n\nwomen, young people, erratic workers, etc. One could even imagine, in\n\nblood and crisis, a more radical reversal that would make the white world\n\nthe periphery of a yellow world; there would doubtless be an entirely\n\ndifferent axiomatic. But what we are talking about is something else,\n\nsomething even that would not resolve: women, nonmen, as a minority, as\n\na nondenumerable flow or set, would receive no adequate expression by\n\nbecoming elements of the majority, in other words, by becoming a\n\ndenumerable finite set. Nonwhites would receive no adequate expression\n\nby becoming a new yellow or black majority, an infinite denumerable set.\n\nWhat is proper to the minority is to assert a power of the nondenumerable,\n\neven if that minority is composed of a single member. That is the formula\n\nfor multiplicities. Minority as a universal figure, or\n\nbecoming-everybody/everything _(devenir tout le monde). _Woman: we all\n\nhave to become that, whether we are male or female. Non-white: we all\n\nhave to become that, whether we are white, yellow, or black.\n\nOnce again, this is not to say that the struggle on the level of the axioms is\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)493.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 471\n\nwithout importance; on the contrary, it is determining (at the most diverse\n\nlevels: women's struggle for the vote, for abortion, for jobs; the struggle of\n\nthe regions for autonomy; the struggle of the Third World; the struggle of\n\nthe oppressed masses and minorities in the East or West...). But there is\n\nalso always a sign to indicate that these struggles are the index of another,\n\ncoexistent combat. However modest the demand, it always constitutes a\n\npoint that the axiomatic cannot tolerate: when people demand to formu-\n\nlate their problems themselves, and to determine at least the particular\n\nconditions under which they can receive a more general solution (hold to\n\nthe _Particular _as an innovative form). It is always astounding to see the\n\nsame story repeated: the modesty of the minorities' initial demands, cou-\n\npled with the impotence of the axiomatic to resolve the slightest corre-\n\nsponding problem. In short, the struggle around axioms is most important\n\nwhen it manifests, itself opens, the gap between two types of propositions,\n\npropositions of flow and propositions of axioms. The power of the minori-\n\nties is not measured by their capacity to enter and make themselves felt\n\nwithin the majority system, nor even to reverse the necessarily tautolog-\n\nical criterion of the majority, but to bring to bear the force of the\n\nnon-denumerable sets, however small they may be, against the\n\ndenumerable sets, even if they are infinite, reversed, or changed, even they\n\nif imply new axioms or, beyond that, a new axiomatic. The issue is not at all\n\nanarchy versus organization, nor even centralism versus decentralization,\n\nbut a calculus or conception of the problems of nondenumerable sets,\n\nagainst the axiomatic of denumerable sets. Such a calculus may have its\n\nown compositions, organizations, even centralizations; nevertheless, it\n\nproceeds not via the States or the axiomatic process but via a pure\n\nbecoming of minorities.\n\n7. _Undecidablepropositions. _It will be objected that the axiomatic itself\n\nmarshals the power of a nondenumerable infinite set: precisely that of the\n\nwar machine. It seems difficult, however, to use the war machine in the gen-\n\neral \"treatment\" of minorities without triggering the absolute war it is sup-\n\nposed to ward off. We have seen the war machine institute quantitative and\n\nqualitative processes, miniaturizations, and adaptations that enable it to\n\ngraduate its attacks or counterattacks, each time as a function of the nature\n\nof the \"unspecified enemy\" (individuals, groups, peoples.. .). But under\n\nthese conditions, the capitalist axiomatic continually produces and repro-\n\nduces what the war machine tries to exterminate. Even the organization of\n\nfamine multiplies the starving as much as it kills them. Even the organiza-\n\ntion of _camps, _an area where the socialist sector has dreadfully distin-\n\nguished itself, does not assure the radical solution of which power dreams.\n\nThe extermination of a minority engenders a minority of that minority.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)494.png)\n\n0\n\n472 \u25a1\n\n7000 B.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE\n\nHowever relentless the killing, it is relatively difficult to liquidate a\npeople\n\nor a group, even in the Third World, once it has enough connections with\n\nelements of the axiomatic. In still other respects, it can be predicted that\n\nthe impending problems of the economy, which will consist in reforming\n\ncapital in relation to new resources (undersea oil, metallic nodules, food-\n\nstuffs), will require not only a redistribution of the world that will\nmobilize\n\nthe worldwide war machine and train its parts on the new objectives; we\n\nwill also probably see the formation or re-formation of minoritarian aggre-\n\ngates, in relation to the affected regions.\n\nGenerally speaking, minorities do not receive a better solution of their\n\nproblem by integration, even with axioms, statutes, autonomies, inde-\n\npendences. Their tactics necessarily go that route. But if they are revolu-\n\ntionary, it is because they carry within them a deeper movement that\n\nchallenges the worldwide axiomatic. The power of minority, of particu-\n\nlarity, finds its figure or its universal consciousness in the proletariat.\nBut\n\nas long as the working class defines itself by an acquired status, or even by\n\na theoretically conquered State, it appears only as \"capital,\" a part of cap-\n\nital (variable capital), and does not leave the _plan(e) of capital. _At best,\nthe\n\nplan(e) becomes bureaucratic. On the other hand, it is by leaving the\n\nplan(e) of capital, and never ceasing to leave it, that a mass becomes\n\nincreasingly revolutionary and destroys the dominant equilibrium of the\n\ndenumerable sets.\n\n67\n\nIt is hard to see what an Amazon-State would be, a\n\nwomen's State, or a State of erratic workers, a State of the \"refusal\" of\n\nwork. If minorities do not constitute viable States culturally, politically,\n\neconomically, it is because the State-form is not appropriate to them, nor\n\nthe axiomatic of capital, nor the corresponding culture. We have often\n\nseen capitalism maintain and organize inviable States, according to its\n\nneeds, and for the precise purpose of crushing minorities. The minorities\n\nissue is instead that of smashing capitalism, of redefining socialism, of\n\nconstituting a war machine capable of countering the world war machine\n\nby other means.\n\nIf the two solutions of extermination and integration hardly seem possi-\n\nble, it is due to the deepest law of capitalism: it continually sets and then\n\nrepels its own limits, but in so doing gives rise to numerous flows in all\n\ndirections that escape its axiomatic. _At the same time as capitalism is\neffec-  \ntuated in the denumerable sets serving as its models, it necessarily consti-  \ntutes nondenumerable sets that cut across and disrupt those models. _It does\n\nnot effect the \"conjugation\" of the deterritorialized and decoded flows\n\nwithout those flows forging farther ahead; without their escaping both the\n\naxiomatic that conjugates them and the models that reterritorialize them;\n\nwithout their tending to enter into \"connections\" that delineate a new\n\nLand; without their constituting a war machine whose aim is neither the\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)495.png)\n\n0\n\n7000\n\nB.C.: APPARATUS OF CAPTURE \u25a1 473\n\nwar of extermination nor the peace of generalized terror, but revolutionary\n\nmovement (the connection of flows, the composition of nondenumerable\n\naggregates, the becoming-minoritarian of everybody/everything). This is\n\nnot a dispersion or a fragmentation: we are instead back at _the opposition  \nbetween, on the one hand, a plane of consistency and, on the other, the plane  \nof organization and development of capital and the bureaucratic socialist  \nplane. _There is in each case a constructivism, a \"diagrammatism,\" operat-\n\ning by the determination of the conditions of the problem and by transver-\n\nsal links between problems: it opposes both the automation of the capitalist\n\naxioms and bureaucratic programming.

But the\n\nde facto mixes do not preclude a de jure, or abstract, distinction between\n\nthe two spaces. That there is such a distinction is what accounts for the fact\n\nthat the two spaces do not communicate with each other in the same way: it\n\nis the de jure distinction that determines the forms assumed by a given de\n\nfacto mix and the direction or meaning of the mix (is a smooth space cap-\n\ntured, enveloped by a striated space, or does a striated space dissolve into a\n\nsmooth space, allow a smooth space to develop?). This raises a number of\n\nsimultaneous questions: the simple oppositions between the two spaces;\n\nthe complex differences; the de facto mixes, and the passages from one to\n\nanother; the principles of the mixture, which are not at all symmetrical,\n\nsometimes causing a passage from the smooth to the striated, sometimes\n\nfrom the striated to the smooth, according to entirely different move-\n\nments. We must therefore envision a certain number of models, which\n\nwould be like various aspects of the two spaces and the relations between\n\nthem.\n\n_**The Technological Model. **_A fabric presents in principle a certain number\n\nof characteristics that permit us to define it as a striated space. First, it\nis\n\nconstituted by two kinds of parallel elements; in the simplest case, there are\n\nvertical and horizontal elements, and the two intertwine, intersect perpen-\n\ndicularly. Second, the two kinds of elements have different functions; one\n\nis fixed, the other mobile, passing above and beneath the fixed.\n\nLeroi-Gourhan has analyzed this particular figure of \"supple solids\" in\n\nbasketry and weaving: stake and thread, warp and woof.' Third, a striated\n\nspace of this kind is necessarily delimited, closed on at least one side: the\n\nfabric can be infinite in length but not in width, which is determined by\n\nthe frame of the warp; the necessity of a back and forth motion implies a\n\nclosed space (circular or cylindrical figures are themselves closed).\n\nFinally, a space of this kind seems necessarily to have a top and a bottom;\n\neven when the warp yarn and woof yarn are exactly the same in nature,\n\nnumber, and density, weaving reconstitutes a bottom by placing the knots\n\non one side. Was it not these characteristics that enabled Plato to use the\n\nmodel of weaving as the paradigm for \"royal science,\" in other words, the\n\nart of governing people or operating the State apparatus?\n\nFelt is a supple solid product that proceeds altogether differently, as an\n\nanti-fabric. It implies no separation of threads, no intertwining, only an\n\nentanglement of fibers obtained by fulling (for example, by rolling the\n\nblock of fibers back and forth). What becomes entangled are the\n\nmicroscales of the fibers. An aggregate of intrication of this kind is in no\n\nway _homogeneous: _it is nevertheless smooth, and contrasts point by point\n\nwith the space of fabric (it is in principle infinite, open, and unlimited in\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)498.png)\n\n0\n\n476 D\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nevery direction; it has neither top nor bottom nor center; it does not assign\n\nfixed and mobile elements but rather distributes a continuous variation).\n\nEven the technologists who express grave doubts about the nomads' pow-\n\ners of innovation at least give them credit for felt: a splendid insulator, an\n\ningenious invention, the raw material for tents, clothes, and armor among\n\nthe Turco-Mongols. Of course, the nomads of Africa and the Maghreb\n\ninstead treat wool as a fabric. Although it might entail displacing the oppo-\n\nsition, do we not detect two very different conceptions or even practices of\n\nweaving, the distinction between which would be something like the dis-\n\ntinction between fabric as a whole and felt? For among sedentaries,\n\nclothes-fabric and tapestry-fabric tend to annex the body and exterior\n\nspace, respectively, to the immobile house: fabric integrates the body and\n\nthe outside into a closed space. On the other hand, the weaving of the\n\nnomad indexes clothing and the house itself to the space of the outside, to\n\nthe open smooth space in which the body moves.\n\nThere are many interfacings, mixes between felt and fabric. Can we not\n\ndisplace the opposition yet again? In knitting, for example, the needles pro-\n\nduce a striated space; one of them plays the role of the warp, the other of\nthe\n\nwoof, but by turns. Crochet, on the other hand, draws an open space in all\n\ndirections, a space that is prolongable in all directions\u2014but still has a cen-\n\nter. A more significant distinction would be between embroidery, with its\n\ncentral theme or motif, and patchwork, with its piece-by-piece construc-\n\ntion, its infinite, successive additions of fabric. Of course, embroidery's\n\nvariables and constants, fixed and mobile elements, may be of extraordi-\n\nnary complexity. Patchwork, for its part, may display equivalents to\n\nthemes, symmetries, and resonance that approximate it to embroidery.\n\nBut the fact remains that its space is not at all constituted in the same way:\n\nthere is no center; its basic motif (\"block\") is composed of a single element;\n\nthe recurrence of this element frees uniquely rhythmic values distinct from\n\nthe harmonies of embroidery (in particular, in \"crazy\" patchwork, which\n\nfits together pieces of varying size, shape, and color, and plays on the _tex-  \nture _of the fabrics). \"She had been working on it for fifteen years, carrying\n\nabout with her a shapeless bag of dingy, threadbare brocade containing\n\nodds and ends of colored fabric in all possible shapes. She could never\n\nbring herself to trim them to any pattern; so she shifted and fitted and\n\nmused and fitted and shifted them like pieces of a patient puzzle-picture,\n\ntrying to fit them to a pattern or create a pattern out of them without using\n\nher scissors, smoothing her colored scraps with flaccid, putty-colored fin-\n\ngers.\"\n\n2\n\nAn amorphous collection of juxtaposed pieces that can be joined\n\ntogether in an infinite number of ways: we see that patchwork is literally a\n\nRiemannian space, or vice versa. That is why very special work groups\n\nwere formed for patchwork fabrication (the importance of the quilting bee\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)499.png)\n\n0\n\n1440:\n\nTHE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED D 477\n\nin America, and its role from the standpoint of a women's collectivity). The\n\nsmooth space of patchwork is adequate to demonstrate that \"smooth\" does\n\nnot mean homogeneous, quite the contrary: it is an _amorphous, _nonformal\n\nspace prefiguring op art.\n\nThe story of the quilt is particularly interesting in this connection. A\n\nquilt comprises two layers of fabric stitched together, often with a filler in\n\nbetween. Thus it is possible for there to be no top or bottom. If we follow\n\nthe history of the quilt over a short migration sequence (the settlers who\n\nleft Europe for the New World), we see that there is a shift from a formula\n\ndominated by embroidery (so-called \"plain\" quilts) to a patchwork for-\n\nmula (\"applique quilts,\" and above all \"pieced quilts\"). The first settlers\n\nof the seventeenth century brought with them plain quilts, embroidered\n\nand striated spaces of extreme beauty. But toward the end of the century\n\npatchwork technique was developed more and more, at first due to the\n\nscarcity of textiles (leftover fabric, pieces salvaged from used clothes,\n\nremnants taken from the \"scrap bag\"), and later due to the popularity of\n\nIndian chintz. It is as though a smooth space emanated, sprang from a\n\nstriated space, but not without a correlation between the two, a recapitu-\n\nlation of one in the other, a furtherance of one through the other. Yet the\n\ncomplex difference persists. Patchwork, in conformity with migration,\n\nwhose degree of affinity with nomadism it shares, is not only named after\n\ntrajectories, but \"represents\" trajectories, becomes inseparable from\n\nspeed or movement in an open space.\n\n3\n\n_**The Musical Model. **_Pierre Boulez was the first to develop a set of\nsimple\n\noppositions and complex differences, as well as reciprocal nonsymmetrical\n\ncorrelations, between smooth and striated space. He created these con-\n\ncepts and words in the field of music, defining them on several levels pre-\n\ncisely in order to account for the abstract distinction at the same time as\nthe\n\nconcrete mixes. In the simplest terms, Boulez says that in a smooth\n\nspace-time one occupies without counting, whereas in a striated\n\nspace-time one counts in order to occupy. He makes palpable or\n\nperceptible the difference between nonmetric and metric multiplicities,\n\ndirectional and dimensional spaces. He renders them sonorous or\n\nmusical.

When\n\nthere is no module, the distribution of frequencies is without break: it is\n\n\"statistical,\" however small the segment of space may be; it still has two\n\naspects, however, depending on whether the distribution is equal\n\n(nondirected smooth space), or more or less rare or dense (directed smooth\n\nspace). Can we say that in the kind of smooth space that is without break or\n\nmodule there is no interval? Or, on the contrary, has everything become\n\ninterval, intermezzo? The smooth is a nomos, whereas the striated always\n\nhas a logos, the octave, for example. Boulez is concerned with the commu-\n\nnication between the two kinds of space, their alternations and superposi-\n\ntions: how \"a strongly directed smooth space tends to meld with a striated\n\nspace,\" how \"a striated space in which the statistical distribution of the\n\npitches used is _in fact _equal tends to meld with a smooth space\";\n\n5\n\nhow the\n\noctave can be replaced by \"non-octave-forming scales\" that reproduce\n\nthemselves through a principle of spiraling; how \"texture\" can be crafted in\n\nsuch a way as to lose fixed and homogeneous values, becoming a support\n\nfor slips in tempo, displacements of intervals, and _son art _transformations\n\ncomparable to the transformations of _op art._\n\nReturning to the simple opposition, the striated is that which inter-\n\ntwines fixed and variable elements, produces an order and succession of\n\ndistinct forms, and organizes horizontal melodic lines and vertical har-\n\nmonic planes. The smooth is the continuous variation, continuous devel-\n\nopment of form; it is the fusion of harmony and melody in favor of the\n\nproduction of properly rythmic values, the pure act of the drawing of a\n\ndiagonal across the vertical and the horizontal.\n\n_**The Maritime Model. **_Of course, there are points, lines, and surfaces in\n\nstriated space as well as in smooth space (there are also volumes, but we will\n\nleave this question aside for the time being). In striated space, lines or\ntra-\n\njectories tend to be subordinated to points: one goes from one point to\n\nanother. In the smooth, it is the opposite: the points are subordinated to the\n\ntrajectory. This was already the case among the nomads for the\n\nclothes-tent-space vector of the outside. The dwelling is subordinated to\n\nthe journey; inside space conforms to outside space: tent, igloo, boat.\n\nThere are stops and trajectories in both the smooth and the striated.

For the sea is a\n\nsmooth space par excellence, and yet was the first to encounter the\n\ndemands of increasingly strict striation. The problem did not arise in prox-\n\nimity to land. On the contrary, the striation of the sea was a result of\nnaviga-\n\ntion on the open water. Maritime space was striated as a function of two\n\nastronomical and geographical gains: _bearings, _obtained by a set of calcula-\n\ntions based on exact observation of the stars and the sun; and _the map, _\n\nwhich intertwines meridians and parallels, longitudes and latitudes, plot-\n\nting regions known and unknown onto a grid (like a Mendeleyev table).\n\nMust we accept the Portuguese argument and assign 1440 as the turning\n\npoint that marked the first decisive striation, and set the stage for the\ngreat\n\ndiscoveries? Rather, we will follow Pierre Chaunu when he speaks of an\n\nextended confrontation at sea between the smooth and the striated during\n\nthe course of which the striated progressively took hold.\n\n8\n\nFor before longi-\n\ntude lines had been plotted, a very late development, there existed a com-\n\nplex and empirical nomadic system of navigation based on the wind and\n\nnoise, the colors and sounds of the seas; then came a directional,\n\npreastronomical or already astronomical, system of navigation employing\n\nonly latitude, in which there was no possibility of \"taking one's bearings,\"\n\nand which had only portolanos lacking \"translatable generalization\"\n\ninstead of true maps; finally, improvements upon this primitive astronom-\n\nical navigation were made under the very special conditions of the lati-\n\ntudes of the Indian Ocean, then of the elliptical circuits of the Atlantic\n\n(straight and curved spaces).\n\n9\n\nIt is as if the sea were not only the archetype\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)502.png)\n\n0\n\n480 \u25a1\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nof all smooth spaces but the first to undergo a gradual striation gridding it\n\nin one place, then another, on this side and that. The commercial cities par-\n\nticipated in this striation, and were often innovators; but only the States\n\nwere capable of carrying it to completion, of raising it to the global level\nof a\n\n\"politics of science.\"\n\n10\n\nA _dimensionality _that subordinated _directionality, _\n\nor superimposed itself upon it, became increasingly entrenched.\n\nThis is undoubtedly why the sea, the archetype of smooth space, was\n\nalso the archetype of all striations of smooth space: the striation of the\n\ndesert, the air, the stratosphere (prompting Virilio to speak of a \"vertical\n\ncoastline,\" as a change in direction). It was at sea that smooth space was\n\nfirst subjugated and a model found for the laying-out and imposition of\n\nstriated space, a model later put to use elsewhere. This does not contradict\n\nVirilio's other hypothesis: in the aftermath of striation, the sea reimparts a\n\nkind of smooth space, occupied first by the \"fleet in being,\" then by the per-\n\npetual motion of the strategic submarine, which outflanks all gridding and\n\ninvents a neonomadism in the service of a war machine still more disturb-\n\ning than the States, which reconstitute it at the limit of their striations.\nThe\n\nsea, then the air and the stratosphere, become smooth spaces again, but, in\n\nthe strangest of reversals, it is for the purpose of controlling striated\nspace\n\nmore completely.\n\n11\n\nThe smooth always possesses a greater power of\n\ndeterritorialization than the striated. When examining the new profes-\n\nsions, or new classes even, how can one fail to mention the military techni-\n\ncians who stare into screens night and day and live for long stretches in\n\nstrategic submarines (in the future it will be on satellites), and the apoca-\n\nlyptic eyes and ears they have fashioned for themselves, which can barely\n\ndistinguish any more between a natural phenomenon, a swarm of locusts,\n\nand an \"enemy\" attack originating at any given point? All of this serves as a\n\nreminder that the smooth itself can be drawn and occupied by diabolical\n\npowers _of organization; _value judgments aside, this demonstrates above all\n\nthat there exist two nonsymmetrical movements, one of which striates the\n\nsmooth, and one of which reimparts smooth space on the basis of the stri-\n\nated. (Do not new smooth spaces, or holey spaces, arise as parries even in\n\nrelation to the smooth space of a worldwide organization? Virilio invokes\n\nthe beginnings of subterranean habitation in the \"mineral layer,\" which\n\ncan take on very diverse values.)\n\nLet us return to the simple opposition between the smooth and the stri-\n\nated since we are not yet at the point where we can consider the dis-\n\nsymmetrical and concrete mixes. The smooth and the striated are\n\ndistinguished first of all by an inverse relation between the point and the\n\nline (in the case of the striated, the line is between two points, while in\nthe\n\nsmooth, the point is between two lines); and second, by the nature of the\n\nline (smooth-directional, open intervals; dimensional-striated, closed\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)503.png)\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED \u25a1 481\n\nintervals). Finally, there is a third difference, concerning the surface or\n\nspace. In striated space, one closes off a surface and \"allocates\" it\naccording\n\nto determinate intervals, assigned breaks; in the smooth, one \"distributes\"\n\noneself in an open space, according to frequencies and in the course of\n\none's crossings _(logos _and _nomos)._\n\nI2\n\nAs simple as this opposition is, it is not\n\neasy to place it. We cannot content ourselves with establishing an immedi-\n\nate opposition between the smooth ground of the nomadic animal raiser\n\nand the striated land of the sedentary cultivator. It is evident that the\npeas-\n\nant, even the sedentary peasant, participates fully in the space of the wind,\n\nthe space of tactile and sonorous qualities. When the ancient Greeks speak\n\nof the open space of the _nomos_\u2014nondelimited, unpartitioned; the\n\npre-urban countryside; mountainside, plateau, steppe\u2014they oppose it not\n\nto cultivation, which may actually be part of it, but to the _polis, _the\ncity,\n\nthe town. When Ibn Khaldun speaks _oibadiya, _bedouinism, the term\n\ncovers cultivators as well as nomadic animal raisers: he contrasts it to  \n_hadara, _or \"city life.\" This clarification is certainly important, but it\ndoes\n\nnot change much. For from the most ancient of times, from Neolithic and\n\neven Paleolithic times, _it is the town that invents agriculture: _it is\nthrough the\n\nactions of the town that the farmers and their striated space are superposed\n\nupon the cultivators operating in a still smooth space (the transhumant\n\ncultivator, half-sedentary or already completely sedentary). So on this\n\nlevel we reencounter the simple opposition we began by challenging,\n\nbetween farmers and nomads, striated land and smooth ground: but only\n\nafter a detour through the town as a force of striation. Now not only the\n\nsea, desert, steppe, and air are the sites of a contest between the smooth\n\nand the striated, but the earth itself, depending on whether there is\n\ncultivation in nomos-space or agriculture in city-space. Must we not say\n\nthe same of the city itself? In contrast to the sea, the city is the striated\nspace\n\npar excellence; the sea is a smooth space fundamentally open to striation,\n\nand the city is the force of striation that reimparts smooth space, puts it\n\nback into operation everywhere, on earth and in the other elements, outside\n\nbut also inside itself. The smooth spaces arising from the city are not only\n\nthose of worldwide organization, but also of a counterattack combining\n\nthe smooth and the holey and turning back against the town: sprawling,\n\ntemporary, shifting shantytowns of nomads and cave dwellers, scrap\n\nmetal and fabric, patchwork, to which the striations of money, work, or\n\nhousing are no longer even relevant. An explosive misery secreted by the\n\ncity, and corresponding to Thorn's mathematical formula: \"retroactive\n\nsmoothing.\"\n\n13\n\nCondensed force, the potential for counterattack?\n\nIn each instance, then, the simple opposition \"smooth-striated\" gives\n\nrise to far more difficult complications, alternations, and superpositions.\n\nBut these complications basically confirm the distinction, precisely\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)504.png)\n\n482 \u25a1 1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nbecause they bring dissymmetrical movements into play. For now, it suf-\n\nfices to say that there are two kinds of voyage, distinguished by the respec-\n\ntive role of the point, line, and space. Goethe travel and Kleist travel?\n\nFrench travel and English (or American) travel? Tree travel and rhizome\n\ntravel? But nothing completely coincides, and everything intermingles, or\n\ncrosses over. This is because the differences are not objective: it is\npossible\n\nto live striated on the deserts, steppes, or seas; it is possible to live\nsmooth\n\neven in the cities, to be an urban nomad (for example, a stroll taken by\n\nHenry Miller in Clichy or Brooklyn is a nomadic transit in smooth space;\n\nhe makes the city disgorge a patchwork, differentials of speed, delays and\n\naccelerations, changes in orientation, continuous variations ... The beat-\n\nniks owe much to Miller, but they changed direction again, they put the\n\nspace outside the cities to new use). Fitzgerald said it long ago: it is not a\n\nquestion of taking off for the South Seas, that is not what determines a voy-\n\nage. There are not only strange voyages in the city but voyages in place: we\n\nare not thinking of drug users, whose experience is too ambiguous, but of\n\ntrue nomads. We can say of the nomads, following Toynbee's suggestion:  \n_they do not move. _They are nomads by dint of not moving, not migrating, of\n\nholding a smooth space that they refuse to leave, that they leave only in\n\norder to conquer and die. Voyage in place: that is the name of all\nintensities,\n\neven if they also develop in extension. To think is to voyage; earlier we\ntried\n\nto establish a theo-noological model of smooth and striated spaces. In\n\nshort, what distinguishes the two kinds of voyages is neither a measurable\n\nquantity of movement, nor something that would be only in the mind, but\n\nthe mode of spatialization, the manner of being in space, of being for space.\n\nVoyage smoothly or in striation, and think the same way... But there are\n\nalways passages from one to the other, transformations of one within the\n\nother, reversals. In his film, _Kings of the Road, _Wenders intersects and\n\nsuperposes the paths of two characters; one of them takes a still educa-\n\ntional, memorial, cultural, Goethean journey that is thoroughly striated,\n\nwhereas the other has already conquered smooth space, and only experi-\n\nments, induces amnesia in the German \"desert.\" But oddly enough, it is the\n\nformer who opens space for himself and performs a kind of retroactive\n\nsmoothing, whereas striae reform around the latter, closing his space again.\n\nVoyaging smoothly is a becoming, and a difficult, uncertain becoming at\n\nthat. It is not a question of returning to preastronomical navigation, nor to\n\nthe ancient nomads. The confrontation between the smooth and the stri-\n\nated, the passages, alternations and superpositions, are under way today,\n\nrunning in the most varied directions.\n\n_The Mathematical Model. _It was a decisive event when the mathematician\n\nRiemann uprooted the multiple from its predicate state and made it a\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)505.png)\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED \u25a1 483\n\nnoun, \"multiplicity.\" It marked the end of dialectics and the beginning of a\n\ntypology and topology of multiplicities. Each multiplicity was defined by _n _\n\ndeterminations; sometimes the determinations were independent of the\n\nsituation, and sometimes they depended upon it. For example, the magni-\n\ntude of a vertical line between two points can be compared to the magni-\n\ntude of a horizontal line between two other points: it is clear that the\n\nmultiplicity in this case is metric, that it allows itself to be striated, and\nthat\n\nits determinations are magnitudes. On the other hand, two sounds of equal\n\npitch and different intensity cannot be compared to two sounds of equal\n\nintensity and different pitch; in this case, two determinations can be com-\n\npared only \"if one is a part of the other and if we restrict ourselves to the\n\njudgment that the latter is smaller than the former, without being able to\n\nsay by how much.\"\n\n14\n\nMultiplicities of this second kind are not metric and\n\nallow themselves to be striated and measured only by indirect means,\n\nwhich they always resist. They are anexact yet rigorous. Meinong and\n\nRussell opposed the notion of _distance _to that of _magnitude._\n\n15\n\nDistances\n\nare not, strictly speaking, indivisible: they can be divided precisely in\ncases\n\nwhere the situation of one determination makes it part of another. But\n\nunlike magnitudes, _they cannot divide without changing in nature each  \ntime. _An intensity, for example, is not composed of addable and\n\ndisplace-able magnitudes: a temperature is not the sum of two smaller\n\ntemperatures, a speed is not the sum of two smaller speeds. Since each\n\nintensity is itself a difference, it divides according to an order in which\neach\n\nterm of the division differs in nature from the others. Distance is therefore\n\na set of ordered differences, in other words, differences that are enveloped\n\nin one another in such a way that it is possible to judge which is larger or\n\nsmaller, but not their exact magnitudes. For example, one can divide\n\nmovement into the gallop, trot, and walk, but in such a way that what is\n\ndivided changes in nature at each moment of the division, without any one\n\nof these moments entering into the composition of any other. Therefore\n\nthese multiplicities of \"distance\" are inseparable from a process of\n\ncontinuous variation, whereas multiplicities of \"magnitude\" distribute\n\nconstants and variables.\n\nThat is why we consider Bergson to be of major importance (much more\n\nso than Husserl, or even Meinong or Russell) in the development of the the-\n\nory of multiplicities. Beginning in _Time and Free Will, _he presents dura-\n\ntion as a type of multiplicity opposed to metric multiplicity or the\n\nmultiplicity of magnitude. Duration is in no way indivisible, but is that\n\nwhich cannot be divided without changing in nature at each division\n\n(Achilles' running is not divided into steps, his steps do not compose it in\n\nthe manner of magnitudes).\n\n16\n\nOn the other hand, in a multiplicity such as\n\nhomogeneous extension, the division can be carried as far as one likes\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)506.png)\n\n0\n\n484 \u25a1\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nwithout changing anything in the constant object; or the magnitudes can\n\nvary with no other result than an increase or a decrease in the amount of\n\nspace they striate. Bergson thus brought to light \"two very different kinds\n\nof multiplicity,\" one qualitative and fusional, continuous, the other\n\nnumerical and homogeneous, discrete. It will be noted that _matter _goes\n\nback and forth between the two; sometimes it is already enveloped in quali-\n\ntative multiplicity, sometimes already developed in a metric \"schema\"\n\nthat draws it outside of itself. The confrontation between Bergson and\n\nEinstein on the topic of Relativity is incomprehensible if one fails to place\n\nit in the context of the basic theory of Riemannian multiplicities, as modi-\n\nfied by Bergson.\n\nWe have on numerous occasions encountered all kinds of differences\n\nbetween two types of multiplicities: metric and nonmetric; extensive and\n\nqualitative; centered and acentered; arborescent and rhizomatic; numeri-\n\ncal and flat; dimensional and directional; of masses and of packs; of magni-\n\ntude and of distance; of breaks and of frequency; _striated and smooth. _Not\n\nonly is that which peoples a smooth space a multiplicity that changes in\n\nnature when it divides\u2014such as tribes in the desert: constantly modified\n\ndistances, packs that are always undergoing metamorphosis\u2014but smooth\n\nspace itself, desert, steppe, sea, or ice, is a multiplicity of this type,\n\nnon-metric, acentered, directional, etc. Now it might be thought that the\n\nNumber would belong exclusively to the _other multiplicities, _that it\n\nwould accord them the scientific status nonmetric multiplicities lack. But\n\nthis is only partially true. It is true that the number is the correlate of\nthe\n\nmetric: magnitudes can striate space only by reference to numbers, and\n\nconversely, numbers are used to express increasingly complex relations\n\nbetween magnitudes, thus giving rise to ideal spaces reinforcing the\n\nstriation and making it coextensive with all of matter. There is therefore a\n\ncorrelation within metric multiplicities between geometry and arithmetic,\n\ngeometry and algebra, which is constitutive of major science (the most\n\nprofound authors in this respect are those who have seen that the number,\n\neven in its simplest forms, is exclusively cardinal in character, and the unit\n\nexclusively divisible).\n\n17\n\nIt could be said on the other hand that nonmetric\n\nmultiplicities or the multiplicities of smooth space pertain only to a minor\n\ngeometry that is purely operative and qualitative, in which calculation is\n\nnecessarily very limited, and the local operations of which are not even\n\ncapable of general translatability or a homogeneous system of location.\n\nYet this \"inferiority\" is only apparent; for the independence of this nearly\n\nilliterate, ametric geometry is what makes possible the independence of the\n\nnumber, the subsequent function of which is to measure magnitudes in\n\nstriated space (or to striate). The number distributes itself in smooth\n\nspace; it does not divide without changing nature each time, without\n\nchanging units, each of which\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)507.png)\n\n0\n\n1440:\n\nTHE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED \u25a1 485\n\nrepresents a distance and not a magnitude. The ordinal, directional, no-\n\nmadic, articulated number, the numbering number, pertains to smooth\n\nspace, just as the numbered number pertains to striated space. So we may\n\nsay of every multiplicity that it is already a number, and still a unit. But\nthe\n\nnumber and the unit, and even the way in which the unit divides, are differ-\n\nent in each case. Minor science is continually enriching major science,\n\ncommunicating its intuitions to it, its way of proceeding, its itinerancy, its\n\nsense of and taste for matter, singularity, variation, intuitionist geometry\n\nand the numbering number.\n\nBut so far we have only considered the first aspect of smooth and\n\nnonmetric multiplicities, as opposed to metric multiplicities: how the situ-\n\nation of one determination can make it part of another without our being\n\nable either to assign that situation an exact magnitude or common unit, or\n\nto discount it. This is the enveloping or enveloped character of smooth\n\nspace. But there is a second, more important, aspect: when the situation of\n\nthe two determinations precludes their comparison. As we know, this is the\n\ncase for Riemannian spaces, or rather, Riemannian patches of space:\n\n\"Riemann spaces are devoid of any kind of homogeneity. Each is charac-\n\nterized by the form of the expression that defines the square of the distance\n\nbetween two infinitely proximate points.... It follows that two neighbor-\n\ning observers in a Riemann space can locate the points in their immediate\n\nvicinity but cannot locate their spaces in relation to each other without a\n\nnew convention. Each vicinity is therefore like a shred of Euclidean space,  \n_but the linkage between one vicinity and the next is not defined and can be  \neffected in an infinite number of ways. Riemann space at its most general  \nthus presents itself as an amorphous collection of pieces that are juxtaposed  \nbut not attached to each other.\" _It is possible to define this multiplicity\n\nwithout any reference to a metrical system, in terms of the conditions of\n\nfrequency, or rather _accumulation, _of a set of vicinities; these conditions\n\nare entirely different from those determining metric spaces and their\n\nbreaks (even though a relation between the two kinds of space necessarily\n\nresults).\n\n18\n\nIn short, if we follow Lautman's fine description, Riemannian\n\nspace is pure patchwork. It has connections, or tactile relations. It has\n\nrhythmic values not found elsewhere, even though they can be translated\n\ninto a metric space. Heterogeneous, in continuous variation, it is a smooth\n\nspace, insofar as smooth space is amorphous and not homogeneous. We\n\ncan thus define two positive characteristics of smooth space in general:\n\nwhen there are determinations that are part of one another and pertain to\n\nenveloped distances or ordered differences, independent of magnitude;\n\nwhen, independent of metrics, determinations arise that cannot be part of\n\none another but are connected by processes of frequency or accumulation.\n\nThese are the two aspects of the _nomos _of smooth space.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)508.png)\n\n0\n\n486 \u25a1\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nWe are always, however, brought back to a dissymmetrical necessity to\n\ncross from the smooth to the striated, and from the striated to the smooth.\n\nIf it is true that itinerant geometry and the nomadic number of smooth\n\nspaces are a constant inspiration to royal science and striated space, con-\n\nversely, the metrics of striated spaces _{metrori) _is indispensable for the\n\ntranslation of the strange data of a smooth multiplicity. Translating is not a\n\nsimple act: it is not enough to substitute the space traversed for the move-\n\nment; a series of rich and complex operations is necessary (Bergson was the\n\nfirst to make this point). Neither is translating a secondary act. It is an\noper-\n\nation that undoubtedly consists in subjugating, overcoding, _metricizing _\n\nsmooth space, in neutralizing it, but also in giving it a milieu of propaga-\n\ntion, extension, refraction, renewal, and impulse without which it would\n\nperhaps die of its own accord: like a mask without which it could neither\n\nbreathe nor find a general form of expression. Major science has a perpet-\n\nual need for the inspiration of the minor; but the minor would be nothing if\n\nit did not confront and conform to the highest scientific requirements. Let\n\nus take just two examples of the richness and necessity of translations,\n\nwhich include as many opportunities for openings as risks of closure or\n\nstoppage: first, the complexity of the means by which one translates inten-\n\nsities into extensive quantities, or more generally, multiplicities of dis-\n\ntance into systems of magnitudes that measure and striate them (the role of\n\nlogarithms in this connection); second, and more important, the delicacy\n\nand complexity of the means by which Riemannian patches of smooth\n\nspace receive a Euclidean conjunction (the role of the parallelism of vectors\n\nin striating the infinitesimal).\n\n19\n\nThe mode of connection proper to patches\n\nof Riemannian space (\"accumulation\") is not to be confused with the\n\nEuclidean conjunction of Riemann space (\"parallelism\"). Yet the two are\n\nlinked and give each other impetus. Nothing is ever done with: smooth\n\nspace allows itself to be striated, and striated space reimparts a smooth\n\nspace, with potentially very different values, scope, and signs. Perhaps we\n\nmust say that all progress is made by and in striated space, but all becoming\n\noccurs in smooth space.\n\nIs it possible to give a very general mathematical definition of smooth\n\nspaces?

This\nis\n\nroughly the case for the warp and the woof, harmony and melody, longitude\n\nand latitude. The more regular the intersection, the tighter the striation,\nthe\n\nmore homogeneous the space tends to become; it is for this reason that\n\nfrom the beginning homogeneity did not seem to us to be a characteristic\n\nof smooth space, but on the contrary, the extreme result of striation, or the\n\nlimit-form of a space striated everywhere and in all directions. If the\n\nsmooth and the homogeneous seem to communicate, it is only because\n\nwhen the striated attains its ideal of perfect homogeneity, it is apt to\n\nreimpart smooth space, by a movement that superposes itself upon that of\n\nthe homogeneous but remains entirely different from it.

(5) You define a general notion of _workas _a force-displacement\n\nrelation in a certain direction. (6) You then have the physical basis for an\n\nincreasingly perfect striated space, running not only vertically and hori-\n\nzontally, but in every direction subordinated to points.\n\nIt is not even necessary to invoke this Newtonian pseudophysics. The\n\nGreeks already went from a space striated vertically, top to bottom, to a\n\ncentered space with reversible and symmetrical relations in all directions,\n\nin other words, striated in every direction in such a way as to constitute a\n\nhomogeneity. There is no question that these are like two models of the\n\nState apparatus, the vertical apparatus of the empire and the isotropic\n\napparatus of the city-state.\n\n21\n\nGeometry lies at the crossroads of a physics\n\nproblem and an affair of the State.\n\nIt is obvious that the striation thus constituted has its limits: they are\n\nreached not only when the infinite (either infinitely large or small) is\n\nbrought in, but also when more than two bodies are considered (\"the\n\nthree-body problem\"). Let us try to understand in the simplest terms how\n\nspace escapes the limits of its striation. At one pole, it escapes them by  \n_declination, _in other words, by the smallest deviation, by the infinitely\n\nsmall deviation between a gravitational vertical and the arc of a circle to\n\nwhich the vertical is tangent. At the other pole, it escapes them by the\n_spiral  \nor vortex, _in other words, a figure in which all the points of space are\n\nsimultaneously occupied according to laws of frequency or of\n\naccumulation, distribution; these laws are distinct from the so-called\n\nlaminar distribution corresponding to the striation of parallels. From the\n\nsmallest deviation to the vortex there is a valid and necessary relation of\n\nconsequence: what stretches between them is precisely a smooth space\n\nwhose element is declination and which is peopled by a spiral. Smooth\n\nspace is constituted by the minimum angle, which deviates from the\n\nvertical, and by the vortex, which overspills striation. The strength of\n\nMichel Serres's book is that it demonstrates this link between the _clinamen _\n\nas a generative differential element, and the formation of vortices and\n\nturbulences insofar as they occupy an engendered smooth space; in fact,\n\nthe atom of the ancients, from Democritus to Lucretius, was always\n\ninseparable from a hydraulics, or a generalized theory of swells and flows.\n\nThe ancient atom is entirely misunderstood if it is overlooked that its\n\nessence is to course and flow. The theory of atomism is the basis for a\n\nstrict correlation between Archimedean geometry (very different from\n\nthe striated and homogeneous space of Euclid) and Democritean physics\n\n(very different from solid or lamellar matter).\n\n22\n\nThe\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)512.png)\n\n0\n\n490 \u25a1\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nsame coincidence means that this aggregate is no longer tied in any way to a\n\nState apparatus, but rather to a war machine: a physics of packs, turbu-\n\nlences, \"catastrophes,\" and epidemics corresponding to a geometry of war,\n\nof the art of war and its machines. Serres states what he considers to be\n\nLucretius's deepest goal: to go from Mars to Venus, to place the war\n\nmachine in the service of peace.\n\n23\n\nBut this operation is not accomplished\n\nthrough the State apparatus; it expresses, on the contrary, an ultimate\n\nmetamorphosis of the war machine, and occurs in smooth space.\n\nEarlier we encountered a distinction between \"free action\" in smooth\n\nspace and \"work\" in striated space. During the nineteenth century a two-\n\nfold elaboration was undertaken: of a physicoscientific concept of Work\n\n(weight-height, force-displacement), and of a socioeconomic concept of\n\nlabor-power or abstract labor (a homogeneous abstract quantity applicable\n\nto all work, and susceptible to multiplication and division). There was a\n\nprofound link between physics and sociology: society furnished an eco-\n\nnomic standard of measure for work, and physics a \"mechanical currency\"\n\nfor it. The wage regime had as its correlate a mechanics of force. Physics\n\nhad never been more social, for in both cases it was a question of defining\n\nthe constant mean value of a force of lift and pull exerted in the most uni-\n\nform way possible by a standard-man. Impose the Work-model upon every\n\nactivity, translate every act into possible or virtual work, discipline free\n\naction, or else (which amounts to the same thing) relegate it to \"leisure,\"\n\nwhich exists only by reference to work. We now understand why the\n\nWork-model, in both its physical and social aspects, is a fundamental part\n\nof the State apparatus. Standard-man began as the man of _public works._\n\n_2_\n\n_* _\n\nIt was not in relation to pin manufacturing that the problems of abstract\n\nlabor, the multiplication of its results, and the division of its operations\n\nwere first formulated; it was in public construction and in the organization\n\nof armies (not only the disciplining of men, but also the industrial\n\nproduction of weapons). Nothing more normal. The war machine in itself\n\ndid not imply this normalization. But the State apparatus, in the\n\neighteenth and nineteenth centuries, found a new way of appropriating\n\nthe war machine: by subjugating it before all else to the Work-model of the\n\nconstruction site and factory, which were in the process of developing\n\nelsewhere, but more slowly. The war machine was perhaps the first thing\n\nto be striated, to produce an abstract labor-time whose results could be\n\nmultiplied and operations divided. That is where free action in smooth\n\nspace must have been conquered. The physicosocial model of Work\n\npertains to the State apparatus, it is one of its inventions, and for two\n\nreasons. First, because labor appears only with the constitution _of a  \nsurplus, _there is no labor that is not devoted to _stockpiling; _in fact,\nlabor\n\n(in the strict sense) begins only with what is called _surplus labor. _Second,\n\nlabor performs a generalized opera-\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)513.png)\n\n0\n\n1440:\n\nTHE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED \u25a1 491\n\ntion of striation of space-time, a subjection of free action, a nullification\nof\n\nsmooth spaces, the origin and means of which is in the essential enterprise\n\nof the State, namely, its conquest of the war machine.\n\nCounterdemonstration: where there is no State and no surplus labor,\n\nthere is no Work-model either. Instead, there is the continuous variation of\n\nfree action, passing from speech to action, from a given action to another,\n\nfrom action to song, from song to speech, from speech to enterprise, all in a\n\nstrange chromaticism with intense but rare peak moments or moments of\n\neffort that the outside observer can only \"translate\" in terms of work. It is\n\ntrue that it has been said of blacks through the ages that \"they don't work,\n\nthey don't know what work is.\" It is true that they were forced to work, and\n\nto work more than anyone else, in terms of abstract quantity. It also seems\n\nto be true that the Indians had no understanding of, and were unsuited\n\nfor, any organization of work, even slavery: the Americans apparently\n\nimported so many blacks only because they could not use the Indians, who\n\nwould rather die. Certain outstanding ethnologists have raised an essential\n\nquestion. They have turned the problem around: so-called primitive socie-\n\nties are not societies of shortage or subsistence due to an absence of work,\n\nbut on the contrary are societies of free action and smooth space that have\n\nno use for a work-factor, anymore than they constitute a stock.\n\n25\n\nThey are\n\nnot societies of sloth, even though their differences with work may be\n\nexpressed in the form of a \"right to laziness.\" They are not without laws,\n\neven though their differences with the law may be expressed in the guise of\n\n\"anarchy.\" What they have instead is a law of the nomos regulating a con-\n\ntinuous variation of activity with a rigor and cruelty all its own (get rid of\n\nwhatever cannot be transported, the old, children . . .).\n\nIf work constitutes a striated space-time corresponding to the State\n\napparatus, is this not especially true of its archaic or ancient forms? For it\nis\n\nthere that surplus labor is isolated, distinguished, in the form of tribute or\n\ncorvee. Consequently, it is there that the concept of labor appears at its\n\nclearest, for example, in the large-scale works of the empires, the urban,\n\nagricultural, or hydraulic works by which a \"laminar\" flow in supposedly\n\nparallel layers (striation) is imposed upon the waters. It seems on the con-\n\ntrary that in the capitalist regime, surplus labor becomes less and less dis-\n\ntinguishable from labor \"strictly speaking,\" and totally impregnates it.\n\nModern public works have a different status from that of large-scale imper-\n\nial works. How could one possibly distinguish between the time necessary\n\nfor reproduction and \"extorted\" time, when they are no longer separated in\n\ntime? This remark certainly does not contradict the Marxist theory of sur-\n\nplus value, for Marx shows precisely that surplus value _ceases to be  \nlocalizable _in the capitalist regime.

In these new\n\nconditions, it remains true that all labor involves surplus labor; but surplus\n\nlabor no longer requires labor. Surplus labor, capitalist organization in its\n\nentirety, operates less and less by the striation of space-time corresponding\n\nto the physicosocial concept of work. Rather, it is as though human aliena-\n\ntion through surplus labor were replaced by a generalized \"machinic\n\nenslavement,\" such that one may furnish surplus-value without doing any\n\nwork (children, the retired, the unemployed, television viewers, etc.). Not\n\nonly does the user as such tend to become an employee, but capitalism\n\noperates less on a quantity of labor than by a complex qualitative process\n\nbringing into play modes of transportation, urban models, the media, the\n\nentertainment industries, ways of perceiving and feeling\u2014every semiotic\n\nsystem. It is as though, at the outcome of the striation that capitalism was\n\nable to carry to an unequaled point of perfection, circulating capital neces-\n\nsarily recreated, reconstituted, a sort of smooth space in which the destiny\n\nof human beings is recast. Striation, of course, survives in the most perfect\n\nand severest of forms (it is not only vertical but operates in all\ndirections);\n\nhowever, it relates primarily to the state pole of capitalism, in other words,\n\nto the role of the modern State apparatuses in the organization of capital.\n\nOn the other hand, at the complementary and dominant level of _integrated  \n(or rather integrating) world capitalism, _a new smooth space is produced in\n\nwhich capital reaches its \"absolute\" speed, based on machinic components\n\nrather than the human component of labor. The multinationals fabricate a\n\nkind of deterritorialized smooth space in which points of occupation as\n\nwell as poles of exchange become quite independent of the classical paths\n\nto striation. What is really new are always the new forms of turnover. The\n\npresent-day accelerated forms of the circulation of capital are making the\n\ndistinctions between constant and variable capital, and even fixed and cir-\n\nculating capital, increasingly relative; the essential thing is instead the\ndis-\n\ntinction between _striated capital _and _smooth capital, _and the way in which\n\nthe former gives rise to the latter through complexes that cut across terri-\n\ntories and States, and even the different types of States.\n\n_**The Aesthetic Model: Nomad Art. **_Several notions, both practical and the-\n\noretical, are suitable for defining nomad art and its successors (barbarian,\n\nGothic, and modern).

The Striated, on\n\nthe contrary, relates to a more distant vision, and a more optical space\u2014\n\nalthough the eye in turn is not the only organ to have this capacity. Once\n\nagain, as always, this analysis must be corrected by a coefficient of\ntransfor-\n\nmation according to which passages between the striated and the smooth\n\nare at once necessary and uncertain, and all the more disruptive. The law of\n\nthe painting is that it be done at close range, even if it is viewed from\nrela-\n\ntively far away. One can back away from a thing, but it is a bad painter who\n\nbacks away from the painting he or she is working on. Or from the \"thing\"\n\nfor that matter: Cezanne spoke of the need to _no longer see _the wheat field,\n\nto be too close to it, to lose oneself without landmarks in smooth space.\n\nAfterward, striation can emerge: drawing, strata, the earth, \"stubborn\n\ngeometry,\" the \"measure of the world,\" \"geological foundations,\" \"every-\n\nthing falls straight down\" . . . The striated itself may in turn disappear in\na\n\n\"catastrophe,\" opening the way for a new smooth space, and another stri-\n\nated space...\n\nA painting is done at close range, even if it is seen from a distance. Simi-\n\nlarly, it is said that composers do not hear: they have close-range hearing,\n\nwhereas listeners hear from a distance. Even writers write with short-term\n\nmemory, whereas readers are assumed to be endowed with long-term\n\nmemory. The first aspect of the haptic, smooth space of close vision is that\n\nits orientations, landmarks, and linkages are in continuous variation; it\n\noperates step by step. Examples are the desert, steppe, ice, and sea, local\n\nspaces of pure connection. Contrary to what is sometimes said, one never\n\nsees from a distance in a space of this kind, nor does one see it from a dis-\n\ntance; one is never \"in front of,\" any more than one is \"in\" (one is \"on\"\n...).\n\nOrientations are not constant but change according to temporary vegeta-\n\ntion, occupations, and precipitation. There is no visual model for points of\n\nreference that would make them interchangeable and unite them in an\n\ninertial class assignable to an immobile outside observer. On the contrary,\n\nthey are tied to any number of observers, who may be qualified as \"mon-\n\nads\" but are instead _nomads _entertaining tactile relations among them-\n\nselves. The interlinkages do not imply an ambient space in which the\n\nmultiplicity would be immersed and which would make distances invari-\n\nant; rather, they are constituted according to ordered differences that give\n\nrise to intrinsic variations in the division of a single distance.\n\n27\n\nThese ques-\n\ntions of orientation, location, and linkage enter into play in the most\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)516.png)\n\n0\n\n494 \u25a1\n\n1440: THE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED\n\nfamous works of nomad art: the twisted animals have no land beneath\n\nthem; the ground constantly changes direction, as in aerial acrobatics; the\n\npaws point in the opposite direction from the head, the hind part of the\n\nbody is turned upside down; the \"monadological\" points of view can be\n\ninterlinked only on a nomad space; the whole and the parts give the eye that\n\nbeholds them a function that is haptic rather than optical. This is an\n\nanimality that can be seen only by touching it with one's mind, but without\n\nthe mind becoming a finger, not even by way of the eye. (In a much cruder\n\nfashion, the kaleidoscope has exactly the same function: to give the eye a\n\ndigital function.) Striated space, on the contrary, is defined by the require-\n\nments of long-distance vision: constancy of orientation, in variance of dis-\n\ntance through an interchange of inertial points of reference, interlinkage by\n\nimmersion in an ambient milieu, constitution of a central perspective. It is\n\nless easy to evaluate the creative potentialities of striated space, and how\nit\n\ncan simultaneously emerge from the smooth and give everything a whole\n\nnew impetus.\n\nThe opposition between the striated and the smooth is not simply that of\n\nthe global and the local. For in one case, the global is still relative,\nwhereas\n\nin the other the local is already absolute. Where there is close vision, space\n\nis not visual, or rather the eye itself has a haptic, nonoptical function: no\n\nline separates earth from sky, which are of the same substance; there is nei-\n\nther horizon nor background nor perspective nor limit nor outline or form\n\nnor center; there is no intermediary distance, or all distance is intermedi-\n\nary. Like Eskimo space.\n\n28\n\nIn a totally different way, in a totally different\n\ncontext, Arab architecture constitutes a space that begins very near and\n\nlow, placing the light and the airy below and the solid and heavy above.\n\nThis reversal of the laws of gravity turns _lack of direction _and negation of\n\nvolume into constructive forces. There exists a nomadic absolute, as a local\n\nintegration moving from part to part and constituting smooth space in an\n\ninfinite succession of linkages and changes in direction. It is an absolute\n\nthat is one with becoming itself, with process. It is the absolute of passage,\n\nwhich in nomad art merges with its manifestation. Here the absolute is\n\nlocal, precisely because place is not delimited. If we now turn to the\nstriated\n\nand optical space of long-distance vision, we see that the relative global\n\nthat characterizes that space also requires the absolute, but in an entirely\n\ndifferent way. The absolute is now the horizon or background, in other\n\nwords, the Encompassing Element without which nothing would be global\n\nor englobed. It is against this background that the relative outline or form\n\nappears. The absolute itself can appear in the Encompassed, but only in a\n\nprivileged place well delimited as a center, which then functions to repel\n\nbeyond the limits anything that menaces the global integration.

Then to the extent that\n\nthe encompassing element itself appears at the center of the earth, it\n\nassumes a second role, that of casting into the loathesome deep, the abode\n\nof the dead, anything smooth or nonmeasured that may have remained.\n\n29\n\nThe striation of the earth implies as its necessary condition this double\n\ntreatment of the smooth: on the one hand, it is carried or reduced to the\n\nabsolute state of an encompassing horizon, and on the other it is expelled\n\nfrom the relative encompassed element. Thus the great imperial religions\n\nneed a smooth space like the desert, but only in order to give it a law that\nis\n\nopposed to the _nomos _in every way, and converts the absolute.\n\nThis perhaps explains for us the ambiguity of the excellent analyses by\n\nRiegl, Worringer, and Maldiney. They approach haptic space under the\n\nimperial conditions of Egyptian art. They define it as the presence of a\n\nhorizon-background; the reduction of space to the plane (vertical and hori-\n\nzontal, height and width); and the rectilinear outline enclosing individual-\n\nity and withdrawing it from change. Like the pyramid-form, every side a\n\nplane surface, against the background of the immobile desert. On the other\n\nhand, they show how in Greek art (then in Byzantine art, and up to the Ren-\n\naissance), an optical space was differentiated from haptic space, one merg-\n\ning background with form, setting up an interference between the planes,\n\nconquering depth, working with cubic or voluminous extension, organiz-\n\ning perspective, and playing on relief and shadow, light and color. Thus at\n\nthe very beginning they encounter the haptic at a point of mutation, in con-\n\nditions under which it already serves to striate space. The optical makes\n\nthat striation tighter and more perfect, or rather tight and perfect in a dif-\n\nferent way (it is not associated with the same \"artistic will\"). Everything\n\noccurs in a striated space that goes from empires to city-states, or evolved\n\nempires. It is not by chance that Riegl tends to eliminate the specific fac-\n\ntors of nomad or even barbarian art; or that Worringer, when he introduces\n\nthe idea of Gothic art in the broadest sense, relates it on the one hand to\nthe\n\nGermanic and Celtic migrations of the North, and on the other to the\n\nempires of the East. But between the two were the nomads, who are reduci-\n\nble neither to empires they confronted nor the migrations they triggered.\n\nThe Goths themselves were nomads of the steppe, and with the Sarmatians\n\nand Huns were an essential vector of communication between the East and\n\nthe North, a factor irreducible to either of these two dimensions.\n\n30\n\nOn one\n\nside, Egypt had its Hyksos, Asia Minor its Hittites, China its\n\nTurco-Mongols; and on the other, the Hebrews had their Habiru, the\n\nGermans, Celts, and Romans their Goths, the Arabs their Bedouins.

Again,\n\nthere is a refusal to accept that the intermediary between the East and the\n\nNorth had its own absolute specificity, that the intermediary, the interval,\n\nplayed exactly this substantial role. Moreover, it does not have that role in\n\nthe guise of a \"will\"; it only has a becoming, it invents a \"becoming-artist.\"\n\nWhen we invoke a primordial duality between the smooth and the stri-\n\nated, it is in order to subordinate the differences between \"haptic\" and\n\n\"optic,\" \"close vision\" and \"distant vision\" to this distinction. Hence we\n\nwill not define the haptic by the immobile background, by the plane and\n\nthe contour, because these have to do with an already mixed state in which\n\nthe haptic serves to striate, and uses its smooth components only in order\n\nto convert them to another kind of space. The haptic function and close\n\nvision presuppose the smooth, which has no background, plane, or con-\n\ntour, but rather changes in direction and local linkages between parts. Con-\n\nversely, the developed optical function is not content to take striation to a\n\nnew level of perfection, endowing it with an imaginary universal value and\n\nscope; it is also capable of reinstating the smooth, liberating light and mod-\n\nulating color, restoring a kind of aerial haptic space that constitutes the\n\nunlimited site of intersection of the planes.\n\n31\n\nIn short, the smooth and the\n\nstriated must be defined in themselves before the relative distinctions\n\nbetween haptic and optical, near and distant, can be derived.\n\nThis is where a third couple enters in: \"abstract line-concrete line\" (in\n\naddition to \"haptic-optical,\" \"close-distant\"). It is Worringer who\n\naccorded fundamental importance to the abstract line, seeing it as the very\n\nbeginning of art or the first expression of an artistic will. Art as abstract\n\nmachine. Once again, it will doubtless be our inclination to voice in\n\nadvance the same objections: for Worringer, the abstract line seems to\n\nmake its first appearance in the crystalline or geometrical imperial Egyp-\n\ntian form, the most rectilinear of forms possible. It is only afterward that\nit\n\nassumes a particular avatar, constituting the \"Gothic or Northern line\"\n\nunderstood very broadly.\n\n32\n\nFor us, on the other hand, the abstract line is\n\nfundamentally \"Gothic,\" or rather, nomadic, not rectilinear. Conse-\n\nquently, we do not understand the aesthetic motivation for the abstract line\n\nin the same way, or its identity with the beginning of art. Whereas the recti-\n\nlinear (or \"regularly\" rounded) Egyptian line is negatively motivated by\n\nanxiety in the face of all that passes, flows, or varies, and erects the con-\n\nstancy and eternity of an In-Itself, the nomad line is abstract in an entirely\n\ndifferent sense, precisely because it has a multiple orientation and passes  \n_between _points, figures, and contours: it is positively motivated by the\n\nsmooth space it draws, not by any striation it might perform to ward off\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)519.png)\n\n0\n\n1440:\n\nTHE SMOOTH AND THE STRIATED \u25a1 497\n\nanxiety and subordinate the smooth. The abstract line is the affect of\n\nsmooth spaces, not a feeling of anxiety that calls forth striation. Further-\n\nmore, although it is true that art begins only with the abstract line, the\nrea-\n\nson is not, as Worringer says, that the rectilinear is the first means of\n\nbreaking with the nonaesthetic imitation of nature upon which the prehis-\n\ntoric, savage, and childish supposedly depend, lacking, as he thinks they\n\ndo, a \"will to art.\" On the contrary, if prehistoric art is fully art it is\nprecisely\n\nbecause it manipulates the abstract, though nonrectilinear, line: \"Primi-\n\ntive art begins with the abstract, and even the prefigurative.... Art is\n\nabstract from the outset, and at its origin could not have been otherwise.\"\n\n33\n\nIn\n\neffect, the line is all the more abstract when writing is absent, either\n\nbecause it has yet to develop or only exists outside or alongside. When writ-\n\ning takes charge of abstraction, as it does in empires, the line, already\n\ndowngraded, necessarily tends to become concrete, even figurative. Chil-\n\ndren forget how to draw. But in the absence of writing, or when peoples\n\nhave no need for a writing system of their own because theirs is borrowed\n\nfrom more or less nearby empires (as was the case for the nomads), the line\n\nis necessarily abstract; it is necessarily invested with all the power of\n\nabstraction, which finds no other outlet. That is why we believe that the dif-\n\nferent major types of imperial lines\u2014the Egyptian rectilinear line, the\n\nAssyrian (or Greek) organic line, the supraphenomenal, encompassing\n\nChinese line\u2014convert the abstract line, rend it from its smooth space, and\n\naccord it concrete values. Still, it can be argued that these imperial lines\nare\n\ncontemporaneous with the abstract line; the abstract line is no less at the\n\n\"beginning,\" inasmuch as it is a pole always presupposed by any line capa-\n\nble of constituting another pole. The abstract line is at the beginning as\n\nmuch because of its historical abstraction as its prehistoric dating. It is\n\ntherefore a part of the originality or irreducibility of nomad art, even when\n\nthere is reciprocal interaction, influence, and confrontation with the\n\nimperial lines of sedentary art.\n\nThe abstract is not directly opposed to the figurative. The figurative as\n\nsuch is not inherent to any \"will to art.\" In fact, we may oppose a figurative\n\nline in art to one that is not. The figurative, or imitation and representa-\n\ntion, is a consequence, a result of certain characteristics of the line when\nit\n\nassumes a given form. We must therefore define those characteristics first.\n\nTake a system in which transversals are subordinated to diagonals, diago-\n\nnals to horizontals and verticals, and horizontals and verticals to points\n\n(even when there are virtual). A system of this kind, which is rectilinear or\n\nunilinear regardless of the number of lines, expresses the formal conditions\n\nunder which a space is striated and the line describes a contour.

It is nevertheless accompanied by _material traits of expression, _the\n\neffects of which multiply step by step. This is what Worringer means when\n\nhe says that the Gothic line (for us, the nomadic line invested with abstrac-\n\ntion) has the power of expression and not of form, that it has repetition as a\n\npower, not symmetry as form. Indeed, it is through symmetry that rectilin-\n\near systems limit repetition, preventing infinite progression and maintain-\n\ning the _organic _domination of a central point with radiating lines, as in\n\nreflected or star-shaped figures. It is free action, however, which by its\n\nessence unleashes the power of repetition as a _machinic _force that multi-\n\nplies its effect and pursues an infinite movement. Free action proceeds by\n\ndisjunction and decentering, or at least by peripheral movement: dis-\n\njointed polythetism instead of symmetrical antithetism.\n\n34\n\nTraits of expres-\n\nsion describing a smooth space and connecting with a matter-flow thus\n\nshould not be confused with striae that convert space and make it a form of\n\nexpression that grids and organizes matter.\n\nWorringer's finest pages are those in which he contrasts the abstract\n\nwith the organic. The organic does not designate something represented,\n\nbut above all the form of representation, and even the feeling that unites\n\nrepresentation with a subject _{Einfuhlung, _\"empathy\"). \"Formal processes\n\noccur within the work of art which correspond to the natural organic ten-\n\ndencies in man.\"\n\n35\n\nBut the rectilinear, the geometrical, cannot be opposed\n\nto the organic in this sense. The Greek organic line, which subordinates\n\nvolume and spatiality, takes over from the Egyptian geometrical line,\n\nwhich reduced them to the plane. The organic, with its symmetry and con-\n\ntours inside and outside, still refers to the rectilinear coordinates of a\nstri-\n\nated space. The organic body is prolonged by straight lines that attach it to\n\nwhat lies in the distance. Hence the primacy of human beings, or of the\n\nface: We are this form of expression itself, simultaneously the supreme\n\norganism and the relation of all organisms to metric space in general. The\n\nabstract, on the contrary, begins only with what Worringer presents as the\n\n\"Gothic\" avatar. It is this nomadic line that he says is mechanical, but in\n\nfree action and swirling; it is inorganic, yet alive, and all the more alive\nfor\n\nbeing inorganic. It is distinguished both from the geometrical and the\n\norganic.

Rather, it is precisely because pure animality is\n\nexperienced as inorganic, or supraorganic, that it can combine so well with\n\nabstraction, and even combine the slowness or heaviness of a matter with\n\nthe extreme speed of a line that has become entirely spiritual. The slowness\n\nbelongs to the same world as the extreme speed: relations of speed and\n\nslowness between elements, which surpass in every way the movement of\n\nan organic form and the determination of organs.

They are Belts, Pincers, or Articulations.\n\nSummarily and traditionally, we distinguish three major strata:\n\nphysicochemical, organic, and anthropomorphic (or \"alloplastic\").\n\nEach stratum, or articulation, consists of coded milieus and formed\n\nsubstances. _Forms and substances, codes and milieus _are not really\n\ndistinct. They are the abstract components of every articulation.\n\nA stratum obviously presents very diverse forms and substances, a\n\nvariety of codes and milieus. It thus possesses both different formal\n\nTypes of organization and different substantial Modes of develop-\n\nment, which divide it into _parastrata and epistrata, _for example, the\n\ndivisions of the organic stratum. The epistrata and parastrata subdi-\n\nviding a stratum can be considered strata themselves (so that the list\n\nis never exhaustive). A given stratum retains a unity of composition\n\nin spite of the diversity in its organization and development. The\n\nunity of composition relates to formal traits common to all of the\n\nforms or codes of a stratum, and to substantial elements, materials\n\ncommon to all of the stratum's substances or milieus.\n\nThe strata are extremely mobile. One stratum is always capable\n\nof serving as the _substratum _of another, or of colliding with\n\nanother, independently of any evolutionary order. Above all,\n\nbe-ween two strata or between two stratic divisions, there are  \n_inter-stratic _phenomena: transcodings and passages between\n\nmilieus, intermixings. Rhythms pertain to these interstratic\n\nmovements, which are also acts of stratification. Stratification is like\n\nthe creation of the world from chaos, a continual, renewed creation.\n\nAnd the strata constitute the Judgment of God. Classical artists are\n\nlike God, they make the world by organizing forms and substances,\n\ncodes and milieus, and rhythms.\n\nArticulation, which is constitutive of a stratum, is always a double\n\narticulation (double pincer). What is articulated is _a content and an  \nexpression. _Whereas form and substance are not really distinct, con-\n\ntent and expression are. Hjelmslev's net is applicable to the strata:\n\narticulation of content and articulation of expression, with content\n\nand expression each possessing its own form and substance. Between\n\nthem, between content and expression, there is neither a correspon-\n\ndence nor a cause-effect relation nor a signified-signifier relation:\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)525.png)\n\nCONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES D 503\n\nthere is real distinction, reciprocal presupposition, and only\n\nisomor-phy. But content and expression are not distinguished from\n\neach other in the same fashion on each stratum: the distribution of\n\ncontent and expression is not the same on the three major strata\n\n(there is, for example, a \"linearization\" of expression on the organic\n\nstratum, and a \"superlinearity\" of the anthropomorphic strata). That\n\nis why the molar and the molecular have very different\n\ncombinations depending on the stratum considered.\n\n3\n\nWhat movement, what impulse, sweeps us outside the strata\n\nand _(metastratd)\"] _Of course, there is no reason to think that all matter is\n\n4 confined to the physicochemical strata: there exists a submolecular,\n\nunformed Matter. Similarly, not all Life is confined to the organic\n\nstrata: rather, the organism is that which life sets against itself in order\n\nto limit itself, and there is a life all the more intense, all the more pow\n\nerful for being anorganic. There are also nonhuman Becomings of\n\nhuman beings that overspill the anthropomorphic strata in all direc\n\ntions. But how can we reach this \"plane,\" or rather how can we con\n\nstruct it, and how can we draw the \"line\" leading us there? For outside\n\nthe strata or in the absence of strata we no longer have forms or sub\n\nstances, organization or development, content or expression. We are\n\ndisarticulated; we no longer even seem to be sustained by rhythms.\n\nHow could unformed matter, anorganic life, nonhuman becoming be\n\nanything but chaos pure and simple? Every undertaking of\n\ndestratification (for example, going beyond the organism, plunging\n\ninto a becoming) must therefore observe concrete rules of extreme\n\n6 caution: a too-sudden destratification may be suicidal, or turn can-\n\ncerous. In other words, it will sometimes end in chaos, the void and\n\ndestruction, and sometimes lock us back into the strata, which\n\nbecome more rigid still, losing their degrees of diversity, differentia-\n\ntion, and mobility.\n\nA\n\n_Assemblages_\n\nAssemblages are already different from strata. They are produced in 11\n\nthe strata, but operate in zones where milieus become decoded: they\n\nbegin by extracting a _territory _from the milieus. Every assemblage is\n\nbasically territorial. The first concrete rule for assemblages is to dis-\n\ncover what territoriality they envelop, for there always is one: in their\n\ntrash can or on their bench, Beckett's characters stake out a territory.\n\nDiscover the territorial assemblages of someone, human or animal:\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)526.png)\n\n0\n\n504 \u25a1\n\nCONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES\n\n\"home.\" The territory is made of decoded fragments of all kinds,\n\nwhich are borrowed from the milieus but then assume the value of\n\n\"properties\": even rhythms take on a new meaning (refrains). The ter-\n\nritory makes the assemblage. The territory is more than the organism\n\nand the milieu, and the relation between the two; that is why the\n\nassemblage goes beyond mere \"behavior\" (hence the importance of\n\nthe relative distinction between territorial animals and milieu\n\nanimals).\n\nInasmuch as they are territorial, assemblages still belong to the\n\nstrata. At least they pertain to them in one of their aspects, and it is\n\nunder this aspect that we distinguish in every assemblage content 4\n\nfrom expression. It is necessary to ascertain the content and the\n\nexpression of each assemblage, to evaluate their real distinction, their\n\nreciprocal presupposition, their piecemeal insertions. The reason that\n\nthe assemblage is not confined to the strata is that expression in it\n\nbecomes a _semiotic system, _a regime of signs, and content becomes a  \n_pragmatic system, _actions and passions. This is the double articulation\n\nface-hand, gesture-word, and the reciprocal presupposition between the\n\ntwo. This is the first division of every assemblage: it is simultaneously\n\nand inseparably a machinic assemblage and an assemblage of\n\nenunciation. In each case, it is necessary to ascertain both what is said\n\nand what is done. There is a new relation between content and\n\nexpression that was not yet present in the strata: the statements or\n\nexpressions express _incorporeal transformations _that are \"attributed\"\n\nas such (properties) to bodies or contents. In the strata, expressions do\n\nnot form signs, nor contents _pragmata, _so this autonomous zone of\n\nincorporeal transformations expressed by the former and attributed to\n\nthe latter does not appear. Of course, regimes of signs develop only in\n\nthe alloplastic or anthropomorphic strata (including territorialized\n\nanimals). But this does not mean that they do not permeate all of the\n\nstrata, and overspill each of them. Assemblages belong to the strata to\n\nthe extent that the distinction between content and expression still\n\nholds for them. We may also think of regimes of signs and pragmatic\n\nsystems as strata in their own right, in the broad sense previously\n\nmentioned. But because the content-expression distinction assumes a\n\nnew figure, we are already in a different element than that of the strata\n\nin the narrow sense.\n\nThe assemblage is also divided along another axis. Its territoriality\n\n(content and expression included) is only a first aspect; the other\n\naspect is constituted by _lines of deterritorialization _that cut across it\n\nand carry it away. These lines are very diverse: some open the territor-\n\nial assemblage onto other assemblages (for example, the territorial\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)527.png)\n\n0\n\nCONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES \u25a1 505\n\nrefrain of the animal becomes a courtship or group refrain). Others\n\noperate directly upon the territoriality of the assemblage, and open it\n\nonto a land that is eccentric, immemorial, or yet to come (for example,\n\nthe game of territory and the earth in the lied, or in the romantic 11 artist\n\nin general). Still others open assemblages onto abstract and cos-and mic\n\nmachines that they effectuate. The territoriality of the assem-4 blage\n\noriginates in a certain decoding of milieus, and is just as necessarily\n\nextended by lines of deterritorialization. The territory is just as\n\ninseparable from deterritorialization as the code from decoding.\n\nFollowing these lines, the assemblage no longer presents an expression\n\ndistinct from content, only unformed matters, destrati-fied forces, and\n\nfunctions. The concrete rules of assemblage thus operate along these two\n\naxes: On the one hand, what is the territoriality of the assemblage, what\n\nis the regime of signs and the pragmatic system? On the other hand,\n\nwhat are the cutting edges of deterritorialization, and what abstract\n\nmachines do they effectuate? The assemblage is tetravalent: (1) content\n\nand expression; (2) territoriality and deterritorialization. That is why\n\nthere were four aspects in the privileged example of Kafka's\n\nassemblages.\n\nR\n\n_Rhizome_\n\nNot only strata, assemblages are complexes of lines. We can identify a\n\nfirst state of the line, or a first kind of line: the line is subordinated to\n\nthe point; the diagonal is subordinated to the horizontal and vertical;\n\nthe line forms a contour, whether figurative or not; the space it consti-\n\ntutes is one of striation; the countable multiplicity it constitutes\n\nremains subordinated to the One in an always superior or supplemen-\n\ntary dimension. Lines of this type are molar, and form a segmentary,\n\ncircular, binary, arborescent system.\n\nThe second kind is very different, molecular and of the \"rhizome\"\n\ntype. The diagonal frees itself, breaks or twists. The line no longer\n\nforms a contour, and instead passes _between _things, _between _points. It\n\nbelongs to a smooth space. It draws a plane that has no more dimen-\n\nsions than that which crosses it; therefore the multiplicity it consti-\n\ntutes is no longer subordinated to the One, but takes on a consistency\n\nof its own. These are multiplicities of masses or packs, not of classes;\n\nanomalous and nomadic multiplicities, not normal or legal ones;\n\nmultiplicities of becoming, or transformational multiplicities, not\n\ncountable elements and ordered relations; fuzzy, not exact aggre-\n\n**10**\n\n9\n\nand\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n12\n\nand 14\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)528.png)\n\n0\n\n506 D\n\nCONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES\n\ngates, etc. At the level _of pathos, _these multiplicities are expressed by\n\npsychosis and especially schizophrenia. At the level of pragmatics,\n\nthey are utilized by sorcery. At the level of theory, the status of multi-\n\nplicities is correlative to that of spaces, and vice versa: smooth spaces\n\nof the type desert, steppe, or sea are not without people; they are not\n\ndepopulated but rather are populated by multiplicities of this second\n\nkind (mathematics and music have gone quite far in the elaboration\n\nof this theory of multiplicities).\n\nIt is not enough, however, to replace the opposition between the\n\nOne and the multiple with a distinction between types of multiplici-\n\n9 ties. For the distinction between the two types does not preclude their\n\nimmanence to each other, each \"issuing\" from the other after its fash-\n\nion. It is not so much that some multiplicities are arborescent and\n\nothers not, but that there is an arborification of multiplicities. That is\n\nwhat happens when the black holes scattered along a rhizome begin\n\nto resonate together, or when the stems form segments that striate\n\nspace in all directions, rendering it comparable, divisible, homoge-\n\n12 neous (as we saw in particular in the case of the Face). That is also\n\nwhat happens when \"mass\" movements or molecular flows conjugate\n\nat points of accumulation or stoppage that segment and rectify them.\n\nBut conversely, and without symmetry, the stems of the rhizome are\n\nalways taking leave of the trees, the masses and flows are constantly\n\nescaping, inventing connections that jump from tree to tree and\n\nuproot them: a whole smoothing of space, which in turn reacts back\n\nupon striated space. Even, and especially, territories are perturbed by\n\nthese deep movements. Or language: the trees of language are shaken\n\nby buddings and rhizomes. So that rhizome lines oscillate between\n\n8 tree lines that segment and even stratify them, and lines of flight or\n\nand rupture that carry them away.\n\n9 We are therefore made of three lines, but each kind of line has its\n\ndangers. Not only the segmented lines that cleave us, and impose\n\nupon us the striations of a homogeneous space, but also the molecular\n\nlines, already ferrying their micro-black holes, and finally the lines of\n\nflight themselves, which always risk abandoning their creative poten\n\ntialities and turning into a line of death, being turned into a line of\n\ndestruction pure and simple (fascism).\n\n**C**\n\n_Plane of Consistency, Body without Organs _\n\nThe plane of consistency or of composition (planomenon) is opposed\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)529.png)\n\n0\n\nCONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES \u25a1 507\n\n10 to the plane of organization and development.

But the plane of\n\nconsistency knows nothing of substance and form: haecceities, which\n\nare inscribed on this plane, are precisely modes of individuation pro-\n\nceeding neither by form nor by the subject. The plane consists\n\nabstractly, but really, in relations of speed and slowness between\n\nunformed elements, and in compositions of corresponding intensive\n\naffects (the \"longitude\" and \"latitude\" of the plane). In another sense,\n\nconsistency concretely ties together heterogeneous, disparate ele-\n\n11 ments as such: it assures the consolidation of fuzzy aggregates, in\n\nother words, multiplicities of the rhizome type. In effect, consistency,\n\nproceeding by consolidation, acts necessarily in the middle, by the\n\nmiddle, and stands opposed to all planes of principle or finality.\n\nSpinoza, Holderlin, Kleist, Nietzsche are the surveyors of such a\n\nplane of consistency. Never unifications, never totalizations, but\n\nrather consistencies or consolidations.\n\n10 Inscribed on the plane of consistency are _haecceities, _events, incor-\n\nporeal transformations that are apprehended in themselves; _nomadic  \nessences, _vague yet rigorous; _continuums of intensities _or continuous\n\n4, 6 variations, which go beyond constants and variables; _becomings,_\n\n_1, _9 which have neither culmination nor subject, but draw one another\n\ninto zones of proximity or undecidability; _smooth spaces, _composed\n\nfrom within striated space. We will say that a body without organs, or\n\n6  bodies without organs (plateaus) comes into play in individuation by\n\nand haecceity, in the production of intensities beginning at a degree zero,\n\n10 in the matter of variation, in the medium of becoming or transforma-\n\ntion, and in the smoothing of space.

Are the Body\n\nwithout Organs and the Plane the same thing? In any event, composer\n\nand composed have the same power: the line does not have a dimen-\n\nsion superior to that of the point, nor the surface to that of the line,\n\n10 nor the volume to that of the surface, but always an anexact, frac-and\n\ntional number of dimensions that constantly increase or decrease\n\n14 with the number of its parts. The plane sections multiplicities of vari-\n\nable dimensions. The question is, therefore, the mode of connection\n\nbetween the different parts of the plane: To what extent do the bodies\n\nwithout organs interconnect?

The plane is like a row of doors. And the concrete\n\nrules for the construction of the plane obtain to the extent that they\n\nexercise a selective role. It is the plane, in other words, the mode of\n\nconnection, that provides the means of eliminating the empty and\n\ncancerous bodies that rival the body without organs, of rejecting the\n\nhomogeneous surfaces that overlay smooth space, and neutralizing\n\nthe lines of death and destruction that divert the line of flight. What\n\nis retained and preserved, therefore created, what consists, is only  \n_that which increases the number of connections _at each level of\n\ndivision or composition, thus in descending as well as ascending\n\norder (that which is cannot be divided without changing in nature, or\n\nenter into a larger composition without requiring a new criterion of\n\ncomparison...).\n\nD\n\n_Deterritorialization_\n\nThe function of deterritorialization: D is the movement by which 5\n\n\"one\" leaves the territory. It is the operation of the line of flight. There\n\nare very different cases. D may be overlaid by a compensatory\n\nreterritorialization obstructing the line of flight: D is then said to be  \n_negative. _Anything can serve as a reterritorialization, in other words,\n\n\"stand for\" the lost territory; one can reterritorialize on a being, an\n\nobject, a book, an apparatus or system.. . For example, it is inaccurate\n\nto say that the State apparatus is territorial: it in fact performs a D, but\n\none immediately overlaid by reterritorializations on property, work,\n\nand money (clearly, that landowner ship, public or private, is not\n\nterritorial but reterritorializing). Among regimes of signs, the  \n_signifying regime _certainly attains a high level of D; but because it\n\nsimultaneously sets up a whole system of reterritorializations on the\n\nsignified, and on the signifier itself, it blocks the line of flight, allowing\n\nonly a negative D to persist. Another case is when D becomes\n\npositive\u2014in other words, when it prevails over the reterritorializations,\n\nwhich play only a secondary role\u2014but nevertheless remains _relative _\n\nbecause the line of flight it draws is segmented, is divided into\n\nsuccessive \"proceedings,\" sinks into black holes, or even ends up in a\n\ngeneralized black hole (catastrophe).

It will be noted immediately that these two major\n\nforms of D are not in a simple evolutionary relation to each other:\n\nthe second may break away from the first, or it may lead into it (nota-\n\nbly when the segmentations of converging lines of flight bring an\n\noverall reterritorialization or one benefiting a particular segment,\n\nthus arresting the movement of escape). There are all kinds of mixed\n\nfigures, assuming highly varied forms of D.\n\nIs there _absolute _D, and what does \"absolute\" mean? We must\n\nfirst have a better understanding of the relations between D, the\n\nterritory, reterritorialization, and the earth. To begin with, the terri-\n\ntory itself is inseparable from vectors of deterritorialization work-\n\n9 ing it from within: either because the territoriality is supple and\n\nand \"marginal,\" in other words, itinerant, or because the territorial\n\n13 assemblage itself opens onto and is carried off by other types of\n\n11 assemblages. Second, D is in turn inseparable from correlative\n\nreterritorializations. D is never simple, but always multiple and\n\ncomposite: not only because it participates in various forms at the same\n\ntime, but also because it converges distinct speeds and movements on\n\nthe basis of which one may assign at a given moment a\n\n\"deterritorialized element\" and a \"deterritorializing element.\" Now,\n\nreterritorialization as an original operation does not express a return to\n\nthe territory, but rather these differential relations inter-7 nal to D\nitself,\n\nthis multiplicity internal to the line of flight (cf. \"The-and orems of D\").\n\nFinally, the earth is not at all the opposite of D: This\n\n10 can already be seen in the mystery of the \"natal,\" in which the earth\n\nas ardent, eccentric, or intense focal point is outside the territory\n\n11 and exists only in the movement of D. More than that, the earth, the\n\nglacial, is Deterritorialization par excellence: that is why it belongs\n\n3 to the Cosmos, and presents itself as the material through which\n\nhuman beings tap cosmic forces. We could say that the earth, as\n\ndeterritorialized, is itself the strict correlate of D. To the point that\n\nD can be called the creator of the earth\u2014of a new land, a universe,\n\nnot just a reterritorialization.\n\nThis is the meaning of \"absolute.\" The absolute expresses nothing\n\ntranscendent or undifferentiated. It does not even express a quantity\n\nthat would exceed all given (relative) quantities. It expresses only a\n\ntype of movement qualitatively different from relative movement. A\n\nmovement is absolute when, whatever its quantity and speed, it\n\n7 relates \"a\" body considered as multiple to a smooth space that it and\n\noccupies in the manner of a vortex. A movement is relative, whatever\n\n14 its quantity and speed, when it relates a body considered as _One _to a\n\nstriated space through which it moves, and which it measures with\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)532.png)\n\n0\n\n510 \u25a1\n\nCONCLUSION: CONCRETE RULES AND ABSTRACT MACHINES\n\nstraight lines, if only virtual. D is negative or relative (yet already\n\neffective) when it conforms to the second case and operates either by\n\nprincipal reterritorializations that obstruct the lines of flight, or by\n\nsecondary reterritorializations that segment and work to curtail\n\nthem. D is absolute when it conforms to the first case and brings\n\nabout the creation of a new earth, in other words, when it connects\n\nlines of flight, raises them to the power of an abstract vital line, or\n\ndraws a plane of consistency. Now what complicates everything is\n\nthat this absolute D necessarily proceeds by way of relative D, pre-\n\ncisely because it is not transcendent. Conversely, relative or negative\n\nD itself requires an absolute for its operation: it makes the absolute\n\nsomething \"encompassing,\" something totalizing that overcodes the\n\nearth and then conjugates lines of flight in order to stop them, destroy\n\nthem\u2014rather than connecting them in order to create (it is in this\n\nsense that we have opposed _conjunction _to _connection, _although we\n\nhave often treated them as synonyms from a very general point of\n\nview). Thus there is a limitative absolute already at work in properly\n\n9 negative, or even relative, D's. Above all, at this turning point the\n\nand lines of flight are not only obstructed or segmented but turn into lines\n\n14 of destruction or death. For the stakes here are indeed the negative\n\nand the positive in the absolute: the earth girded, encompassed,\n\n11 overcoded, conjugated as the object of a mortuary and suicidal\n\norganization surrounding it on all sides, _or _the earth consolidated,\n\nconnected with the Cosmos, brought into the Cosmos following lines\n\nof creation that cut across it as so many becomings (Nietzsche's\n\nexpression: Let the earth become lightness . . .). There are thus at\n\nleast four forms of D that confront and combine, and must be distin-\n\nguished from one another following concrete rules.\n\nM\n\n_Abstract Machines (Diagram and Phylum)_\n\nThere is no abstract machine, or machines, in the sense of a Platonic\n\nIdea, transcendent, universal, eternal. Abstract machines operate within\n\nconcrete assemblages: They are defined by the fourth aspect of\n\nassemblages, in other words, the cutting edges of decoding and 11\n\ndeterritorialization. They draw these cutting edges. Therefore they\n\nmake the territorial assemblage open onto something else, assemblages\n\nof another type, the molecular, the cosmic; they constitute becomings.\n\nThus they are always singular and immanent.

This is what\n\nmakes them abstract, and also defines the concept of the machine in\n\nthe strict sense. They surpass any kind of mechanics. They are\n\nopposed to the abstract in the ordinary sense. Abstract machines\n\nconsist of _unformed matters and nonformal functions. _Every abstract\n\nmachine is a consolidated aggregate of matters-5 functions _{phylum _\n\nand _diagram). _This is evident on a technological \"plane\": such a plane\n\nis not made up simply of formed substances (aluminum, plastic,\n\nelectric wire, etc.) or organizing forms (program, prototypes, etc.), but\n\nof a composite of unformed matters exhibiting only degrees of\n\nintensity (resistance, conductivity, heating, stretching, speed or delay,\n\ninduction, transduction . . .) and diagrammatic functions exhibiting\n\nonly differential equations or, more generally, \"tensors.\" Of course,\n\nwithin the dimensions of the assemblage, the abstract machine, or\n\nmachines, is effectuated in forms and substances, in varying states of\n\nfreedom. But the abstract machine must first have composed itself, and\n\nhave simultaneously composed a plane of consistency. Abstract,\n\nsingular, and creative, here and now, real yet nonconcrete, actual yet\n\nnoneffectuated\u2014that is why abstract machines are dated and named\n\n(the Einstein abstract machine, the Webern abstract machine, but also\n\nthe Galileo, the Bach, or the Beethoven, etc.). Not that they refer to\n\npeople or to effectuating moments; on the contrary, it is the names and\n\ndates that refer to the singularities of the machines, and to what they\n\neffectuate.\n\nBut if abstract machines know nothing of form and substance,\n\nwhat happens to the other determination of strata, or even of\n\nassemblages\u2014content and expression? In a certain sense, it could be\n\nsaid that this distinction is also irrelevant to the abstract machine,\n\n3 precisely because it no longer has the forms and substances the dis\n\ntinction requires. The plane of consistency is a plane of continuous\n\nvariation; each abstract machine can be considered a \"plateau\" of\n\nvariation that places variables of content and expression in continu\n\nity. Content and expression thus attain their highest level of relativ\n\nity, becoming \"functives of one and the same function\" or materials\n\nof a single matter [see 4, \"November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguis\n\ntics,\" note 21\u2014Trans.]. But in another sense, it could be said that the\n\n4 distinction subsists, and is even recreated, on the level _oi traits: _there\n\nand are traits of content (unformed matters or intensities) and traits of\n\n5 expression (nonformal functions or tensors).

Thus both content and expression are\n\nnecessarily affected by continuous variation, but it still assigns them two\n\ndissymmetrical roles as elements of a single becoming, or as quanta of a\n\nsingle flow. That is why it is impossible to define a continuous variation\n\nthat would not take in both the content and the expression, rendering\n\nthem indiscernible, while simultaneously proceeding by one _or _the other,\n\ndetermining the two mobile and relative poles of that which has become\n\nindiscernible. For this reason, one must define both traits or intensities of\n\ncontent and traits or ten-1, 2 sors of expression _(indefinite article, proper  \nname, infinitive, and _4, 10 _date), _which take turns leading one another\n\nacross the plane of consistency. Unformed matter, the phylum, is not\n\ndead, brute, homo-12 geneous matter, but a matter-movement bearing\n\nsingularities or haecceities, qualities, and even operations (itinerant\n\ntechnological lineages); and the nonformal function, the diagram, is not\n\nan inexpressive metalanguage lacking a syntax, but an\n\nexpressivity-movement always bearing a foreign tongue within each\n\nlanguage and 4 nonlinguistic categories within language as a whole\n\n(nomad poetic lineages). One writes, then, on the same level as the real\n\nof an unformed matter, at the same time as that matter traverses and\n\nextends all of nonformal language: a becoming-animal like Kafka's\n\n10 mouse [p. 243], Hofmannsthal's rats [p. 240], Moritz's calves [p.\n\n240]? A revolutionary machine, all the more abstract for being real. A\n\nregime that no longer operates by the signifier or the subjective.\n\nThat covers singular and immanent abstract machines. What we\n\nhave said does not preclude the possibility of \"the\" abstract machine\n\nserving as a transcendent model, under very particular conditions.\n\nThis time the concrete assemblages are related to an abstract idea of\n\nthe Machine and, depending on how they effectuate it, are assigned\n\ncoefficients taking into account their potentialities, their creativity.\n\nThe coefficients that \"quantify\" assemblages bear on the varying\n\nassemblage components (territory, deterritorialization,\n\nreterritori-alization, earth, Cosmos), the various entangled lines\n\nconstituting the \"map\" of an assemblage (molar lines, molecular\n\nlines, lines of flight), and the different relations-between the\n\nassemblage and the plane of consistency (phylum and diagram). For\n\nexample, the \"grass stem\" component may have different\n\ncoefficients in assemblages of\n\n11 animal species that are nevertheless closely related [p. 324-25].

They do not\n\nhave the same relation to the phylum, the diagram; they do not have\n\nthe same lines, or the same components. This analysis of the two\n\n12 assemblages and their coefficients demonstrates _that the war ma- _\n\nand _chine does not in itself have war for its object, _but necessarily adopts\nit\n\n13 as its object when it allows itself to be appropriated by the State appa\n\nratus. At this very precise point, the line of flight and the abstract vital\n\nline it effectuates turn into a line of death and destruction. Hence the\n\nname war \"machine,\" which is much closer to the abstract machine\n\nthan is the State apparatus, which divests the war machine of its\n\npower of metamorphosis. Writing and music can be war machines.\n\nThe more an assemblage opens and multiplies connections and draws\n\na plane of consistency with its quantifiers of intensities and of consol-\n\n1, 4 idation, the closer it is to the living abstract machine. But it strays\n\n5, 9 from it to the extent that it replaces creative connections with con-\n\n12 junctions causing blockages _(axiomatics), _organizations forming\n\nand strata _(stratometers), _reterritorializations forming black holes\n\n14 _(segmentometers), _and conversions into lines of death _(deleometers). _\n\nThus there is a whole process of selection of assemblages according to\n\ntheir ability to draw a plane of consistency with an increasing number\n\nof connections. Schizoanalysis is not only a qualitative analysis of\n\nabstract machines in relation to the assemblages, but also a quantita\n\ntive analysis of the assemblages in relation to a presumably pure\n\nabstract machine.\n\nThere is one last point of view, that of typological analysis. For\n\nthere exist general types of abstract machines. The abstract machine or\n\nmachines of the plane of consistency do not exhaust or dominate the\n\nentirety of the operations that constitute the strata and even the\n\nassemblages. The strata \"take\" on the plane of consistency itself,\n\nforming areas of thickening, coagulations, and belts organized and\n\ndeveloping along the axes of another plane (substance-form, content-3\n\nexpression). This means that each stratum has a unity of consistency\n\nor of composition relating above all to substantial elements and formal\n\ntraits, and testifying to the existence of a properly stratic abstract\n\nmachine presiding over this other plane.

This book contains a fine analysis of geography and its role in\nAmerican mythology\n\nand literature, and of the reversal of directions. In the East, there was the\nsearch for a specifi-\n\ncally American code and for a recoding with Europe (Henry James, Eliot, Pound,\netc.); in the\n\nSouth, there was the overcoding of the slave system, with its ruin and the\nruin of the planta-\n\ntions during the Civil War (Faulkner, Caldwell); from the North came\ncapitalist decoding\n\n(Dos Passos, Dreiser); the West, however, played the role of a line of flight\ncombining travel,\n\nhallucination, madness, the Indians, perceptive and mental experimentation,\nthe shifting of\n\nfrontiers, the rhizome (Ken Kesey and his \"fog machine,\" the beat generation,\netc.). Every\n\ngreat American author creates a cartography, even in his or her style; in\ncontrast to what is\n\ndone in Europe, each makes a map that is directly connected to the real social\nmovements\n\ncrossing America. An example is the indexing of geographical directions\nthroughout the work\n\nof Fitzgerald.\n\n19.

He develops a theory\nof \"linguistic\n\npresupposition\" or nondiscursive implicitness, as opposed to concluded and\ndiscursive\n\nimplicitness still referring to a code. He constructs a pragmatics covering\nall of linguistics and\n\nmoves toward a study of assemblages of enunciation, considered from a\n\"juridical,\" \"polemi-\n\ncal,\" or \"political\" point of view.\n\n10. Bakhtin and Labov have stressed the social character of enunciation, in different\n\nways. They are consequently in opposition not only to subjectivism but also to\nstructuralism,\n\nto the extent that the latter ties the system of language to the understanding\nof an ideal indi-\n\nvidual, and social factors to actual individuals as speakers.\n\n11. Ducrot, _Dire et nepas dire, _p. 77: \"To qualify an action as criminal (theft, fraud, black-\n\nmail, etc.) is not, in our sense of the term, to present it as an _act _since\nthe legal situation of guilt,\n\nwhich defines a crime, is supposed to derive from other given consequences of\nthe activity\n\ndescribed: the activity is considered punishable because it is harmful to\nanother person, to\n\norder, to society, etc. The judge's statement of a sentence can, on the other\nhand, be consid-\n\nered a juridical act because there is no intervening effect between the speech\nof the judge and\n\nthe transformation of the accused into a convict.\"\n\n12.

Elias Canetti is one of the rare authors who has dealt with the psychological mode of\n\naction of the order-word, or \"command\": _Crowds and Power, _trans. Carol\nStewart (New\n\nYork: Viking Press, 1963), pp. 303-333. He hypothesizes that an order inflicts\na kind of sting\n\non the soul, which forms a cyst, a hardening that never goes away. When this\nhappens, the\n\nonly way to find relief is to pass it on to others as quickly as possible, to\n\"massify,\" even\n\nthough the mass may turn back against the emitter of the order-word. In\naddition, the fact\n\nthat the order-word is like a foreign body within the body, an indirect\ndiscourse within\n\nspeech, explains the extraordinary forgetting that occurs: \"The person who\ncarries out a\n\ncommand. . . does not accuse himself, but the sting: this is the true culprit,\nwhom he carries\n\nwith him everywhere.... It is his permanent witness that it was not he himself\nwho perpe-\n\ntrated a given wrong. He sees himself as its victim and thus has no feeling\nleft for the real vic-\n\ntim. It is true, therefore, that people who have acted on orders can feel\nentirely guiltless,\"\n\nmaking it all the easier for them to move on to other order-words (p. 332).\nThis provides a\n\nprofound explanation for the Nazis' feeling of innocence, or for the capacity\nof forgetfulness\n\ndisplayed by old Stalinists, whose amnesia worsens the more they invoke their\nmemory and\n\npast in order to claim the right to follow new and even more insidious order-\nwords\u2014\"sting\n\nmania.\" In this respect, Canetti's analysis seems essential. However, it\npresupposes the exis-\n\ntence of a very particular psychic faculty in the absence of which the order-\nword would not\n\nhave this mode of action. The whole classical rationalist theory\u2014of \"common\nsense,\" of\n\nuniversally shared good sense based on information and communication\u2014is a way\nto cover\n\nup or hide, and to justify in advance, a much more disturbing faculty, that of\norder-words.\n\nThis singularly irrational faculty is best safeguarded by gracing it with the\nname of pure rea-\n\nson, by saying that it is nothing but pure reason ...\n\n18.

In this respect, the linguistic history of\nFrench is not at all\n\nthe same as that of English; neither is their relation to writing as a form of\nhomogenization the\n\nsame. For French, the centralized language par excellence, one may refer to\nthe analysis of\n\nMichel de Certeau, Dominique Julia, and Jacques Revel, _Une politique de la\nlangue _(Paris:\n\nGallimard, 1975). The analysis covers a very brief period at the end of the\neighteenth century,\n\nfocusing on Abbot Gregory, and notes two distinct periods: one in which the\ncentral language\n\nopposed the rural dialects, just as the town opposed the countryside, and the\ncapital the prov-\n\ninces; and another in which it opposed \"feudal idioms,\" as well as the\nlanguage of the emigres,\n\njust as the Nation opposes everything that is foreign to it, an enemy of it\n(pp. 160ff: \"It is also\n\nobvious that the rejection of the dialects resulted from a technical inability\nto grasp stable\n\nlaws in regional speech patterns\").\n\n37.

On the double aspect of minor language, poverty-ellipsis, and overload-variation, one\n\nmay refer to a certain number of exemplary studies: Klauss Wagenbach's study\nof the German\n\nof Prague at the beginning of the twentieth century _(Franz Kafka. Eine\nBiographie seiner  \nJugend _[Bern: Francke, 1958]); Pasolini's study demonstrating that Italian\nwas not con-\n\nstructed on the basis of a new standard or mean, but exploded in two\nsimultaneous directions,\n\n\"upward and downward,\" in other words, toward simplified material and\nexpressive exagger-\n\nation _(L'experience heretique, _pp. 46-47); J.

Robert Hurley (New York: Pantheon, 1978), takes yet\nanother  \ndirection since assemblages are no longer related to and contrasted with a\ndiagram, but rather  \nto a \"biopoli-tics of population\" as an abstract machine. Our only points of\ndisagreement with  \nFoucault are the following: (1) to us the assemblages seem fundamentally to be\nassemblages  \nnot of power but of desire (desire is always assembled), and power seems to be\na stratified  \ndimension of the assemblage; (2) the diagram and abstract machine have lines\nof flight that are  \nprimary, which are not phenomena of resistance or counterattack in an\nassemblage, but  \ncutting edges of creation and deterritorialization.\n\n40.

Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss (Cambridge, Mass.:\nHarvard University  \nPress, 1931-1958). But his distinctions are based on signifier-signified\nrelations (contiguity  \nfor the index, similitude for the icon, conventional rule for the symbol);\nthis leads him to make  \nthe \"diagram\" a special case of the icon (the icon of relation). Peirce is the\ntrue inventor of  \nsemiotics. That is why we can borrow his terms, even while changing their\nconnotations. First,  \nindexes, icons, and symbols seem to us to be distinguished by  \nterritoriality-deterritorializa-tion relations, not signifier-signified\nrelations. Second, the  \ndiagram as a result seems to have a distinct role, irreducible to either the\nicon or the symbol.  \nOn Peirce's fundamental distinctions and the complex status of the diagram,\none may refer  \nto Jakobson's analysis, \"A la recherche de l'essence du langage,\" in\n_Problemes du langage,  \n_ed.

The strength of Jean-Pierre Faye's book, _Langages totalitaires _(Paris: Hermann,\n\n1972), is that it illustrates the multiplicity of these focuses, both\npractical and semiotic, on the\n\nbasis of which Nazism was constituted. That is why Faye is the first both to\ndo a rigorous anal-\n\nysis of the concept of the totalitarian State (in its Italian and German\norigins) and to refuse to\n\ndefine Italian fascism and German Nazism by that concept (which operates on a\ndifferent\n\nplane than the \"subjacent process\").

But it is difficult to see, first of\nall, why masses are not\n\nthemselves historical variables, and second, why the word is applied only to\nthe exploited (the\n\n\"peasant-plebeian\" mass), when it is also suitable for seigneurial, bourgeois\nmasses\u2014or even\n\nmonetary masses.\n\n21.

One may\n\nalso refer to the studies on leopard-man societies, etc., in Black Africa; it\nis probable that these\n\nsocieties derive from brotherhoods of warriors.

A hero, or even two heroes with a fiancee in each other's\nvillage, triumphs\n\nover the man-animal. It is as though it were necessary to distinguish two very\ndifferent states\n\nof alliance: a demonic alliance that imposes itself from without, and imposes\nits law upon all\n\nof the filiations (a forced alliance with the monster, with the man-animal),\nand a consensual\n\nalliance, which is on the contrary in conformity with the law of filiations\nand is established\n\nafter the men of the villages have defeated the monster and have organized\ntheir own rela-\n\ntions. This sheds new light on the question of incest. For it is not enough to\nsay that the prohi-\n\nbition against incest results from the positive requirements of alliance in\ngeneral. There is\n\ninstead a kind of alliance that is so foreign and hostile to filiation that it\nnecessarily takes the\n\nposition of incest (the man-animal always has a relation to incest). The\nsecond kind of alliance\n\nprohibits incest because it can subordinate itself to the rights of filiation\nonly by lodging itself,\n\nprecisely, between two distinct filiations. Incest appears twice, once as a\nmonstrous power of\n\nalliance when alliance overturns filiation, and again as a prohibited power of\nfiliation when\n\nfiliation subordinates alliance and must distribute it among distinct\nlineages.\n\n22.

He dis-\n\ntinguishes between an interior time, enveloped in the \"process,\" and an\nexterior time per-\n\ntaining to the distinction between epochs _(Epoques et niveaux temporels dans\nlesysteme de  \nla conjugaisonfrancaise, Cahiers de linguistique structurale _[Universite de\nLaval, Quebec],\n\nno. 4 [1955]). It seems to us that these two poles correspond respectively to\nthe\n\ninfinitive-becoming, Aeon, and the present-being, Chronos. Each verb leans\nmore or less in\n\nthe direction of one pole or the other, not only according to its nature, but\nalso according\n\nto the nuances of its modes and tenses, with the exception of \"becoming\" and\n\"being,\"\n\nwhich correspond to both poles.

We have already encountered this problem of the indifference of psychoanalysis to\n\nthe use of the indefinite article or pronoun among children: as early as\nFreud, but more espe-\n\ncially in Melanie Klein (the children she analyzes, in particular, Little\nRichard, speak in terms\n\nof \"a,\" \"one,\" \"people,\" but Klein exerts incredible pressure to turn them\ninto personal and\n\npossessive family locutions). It seems to us that Laplanche and Pontalis are\nthe only ones in\n\npsychoanalysis to have had any inkling that indefinites play a specific role;\nthey protested\n\nagainst any overrapid interpretive reduction: \"Fantasme originaire,\" _Les\ntemps modernes, _\n\nno. 215 (April 1964), pp. 1861, 1868.\n\n42.

That is why we were able to take Goethe as an example of a transcendental plane.\n\nGoethe, however, passes for a Spinozist; his botanical and zoological studies\nuncover an\n\nimmanent plane of composition, which allies him to Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire\n(this resem-\n\nblance has often been pointed out). Nonetheless, Goethe retains the twofold\nidea of a devel-\n\nopment of form and a formation-education of the Subject; for this reason, his\nplane of\n\nimmanence has already crossed over to the other side, to the other pole.\n\n53. On all of these points (proliferations-dissolutions, accumulations, indications of\n\nspeed, the affective and dynamic role), see Pierre Boulez, _Conversations with\nCelestin  \nDeliege, _pp. 21-22, 68-71. In another text, Boulez stresses a little-known\naspect of Wagner:\n\nnot only are the leitmotifs freed from their subordination to the scenic\ncharacters, but the\n\nspeeds of development are freed from the hold of a \"formal code\" or a tempo\n(\"Le temps\n\nre-cherche,\" in _Das Rheingold Programmheft, _vol.

This text has been frequently commented upon from\nthe viewpoint of  \npsychoanalysis; above all, J.-B. Pontalis, _Apres Freud _(Paris: Gallimard,\n1968). But psycho-  \nanalysis remains prisoner to a necessarily disguised content and a necessarily\nsymbolic form  \n(structure, absent cause ...), at a level that defines both the unconscious\nand language. That is  \nwhy, in its aesthetic or literary applications, it misses the secret _in _an\nauthor, as well as the  \nsecret _oj_an author. The same goes for the secret of Oedipus: they concern\nthemselves with the  \nfirst two kinds of secret but not with the second, which is nevertheless the\nmost important.\n\n80.

The  \naim of statements like those of Mondrian on the exclusive value of the\nvertical and the hori-  \nzontal is to show the conditions under which the vertical and horizontal are\nsufficient to cre-  \nate a transversal, which does not even have to be drawn; for example,\ncoordinates of unequal  \nthickness intersect inside the frame and extend outside the frame, opening a\n\"dynamic axis\"  \nrunning transversally (see Michel Butor's comments in _Repertoire _[Paris:\nMinuit, 1960- ], vol.  \n3, \"Le carre et son habitant\").

Although Luciano Berio indicates otherwise, it seems to us that his work, _Visage, _is\n\ncomposed according to the three states of faciality: first, a multiplicity of\nsound bodies and  \nsilhouettes, then a short symphonic and dominant organization of the face, and\nfinally a  \nlaunching of probe-heads in all directions. However, there is no question here\nof music \"imi-  \ntating\" the face and its avatars, or of the voice constituting a metaphor.\nInstead, the sounds  \naccelerate the deterritorialization of the face, giving it a properly\nacoustical power, and the  \nface reacts musically by in turn inducing a deterritorialization of the voice.\nThis is a molecu-  \nlar face, produced by electronic music. The voice precedes the face, itself\nforms the face for  \nan instant, and outlives it, increasing in speed\u2014on the condition that it is\nunarticulated,  \nasignifying, asubjective.\n\n92.

Andre Tetry, _Les outils chez les etres vivants _(Paris: Gallimard, 1948), the chapter on\n\n\"musical instruments,\" with bibliography. An animal's movement or labor may\nmake noise,  \nbut we speak of a musical instrument whenever animals use apparatuses whose\nsole function  \nis to produce various sounds (the musical character, to the extent that it is\ndeterminable, is  \nquite variable, as is the case with the vocal apparatus of birds; there are\nveritable virtuosos  \namong insects). From this standpoint, we distinguish: (1) stridulatory\napparatuses, of the  \nstringed instrument type: the rubbing of a rigid surface against another\nsurface (insects, crus-  \ntaceans, spiders, scorpions, pedipalps); (2) percussive apparatuses, of the\ndrum, cymbal, or  \nxylophone type: direct application of muscles to a vibratory membrane\n(crickets and certain  \nfish). Not only is there an infinite variety of apparatuses and sounds, but\nthe same animal  \nvaries its rhythm, tonality, intensity according to still more mysterious\nurgencies. \"It then be-  \ncomes a song of anger, anxiety, fear, triumph, love. When there is keen\nexcitation, the rhythm  \nof the stridulation varies: in _Crioceris lilii, _the frequency of the rubbing\ngoes from 228 strokes  \nper minute to 550 or more.\"\n\n102.

See _L'Odyss'ee sous-marine de I'equipe Cousteau, _film no. 36, _La marche des _\n\n_langoustes _(L. R. A.), commentary by Cousteau-Diole: spiny lobsters along\nthe northern coast\n\nof the Yucatan Peninsula sometimes leave their territories. They assemble, at\nfirst in small\n\ngroups, before the first winter storm, and before any sign detectable by human\ninstruments.\n\nWhen the storm comes, they form long march processions, in single file, with a\nleader that is\n\nperiodically relieved and a rearguard (the speed of the march is five-eighths\nof a mile per hour,\n\nfor sixty miles or more). This migration does not seem to be associated with\negg laying, which\n\ndoes not take place until six months later. Hernnkind, a lobster specialist,\nhypothesizes that\n\nthis is a \"vestige\" from the last ice age (more than 10,000 years ago).\nCousteau leans toward a\n\nmore current interpretation, even mentioning the possibility that it is a\npremonition of a new\n\nice age. The factual issue is that in this exceptional case the lobsters'\nterritorial assemblage\n\nopens onto a social assemblage, and that this social assemblage is connected\nto cosmic forces,\n\nor, as Cousteau says, \"pulsations of the earth.\" But \"the enigma remains\nentirely unsolved,\"\n\nall the more so because this lobster procession occasions a slaughter by\nfishermen, and also\n\nbecause lobsters cannot be tagged since they shed their shells.\n\n27.

The territorial character of nursery rhymes appears in\nsuch privileged\n\nexamples as \"Pimpanicaille,\" two distinct versions of which exist in Gruyeres\non \"the two\n\nsides of the street\" (pp. 27-28); but it is a nursery rhyme in the strict\nsense only when there is a\n\ndistribution of specialized roles in a game, and the formation of an\nautonomous game assem-\n\nblage that reorganizes the territory.\n\n28. Nikolaas Tinbergen, _The Study of Instinct _(Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1969).\n\n29. On the one hand, the experiments of W. R. Hess have shown that there is not a cere-\n\nbral center but instead points that are concentrated in one zone and\ndisseminated in another,\n\nand are capable of inciting the same effect; conversely, the effect may change\naccording to the\n\nduration and intensity of the excitation of a point. On the other hand, E. von\nHoist's experi-\n\nments on \"deafferented\" fish demonstrate the importance of central nervous\ncoordination in\n\nfin rhythms; Tinbergen's schema takes these interactions into account only\nsecondarily. The\n\nhypothesis of a \"population of oscillators\" or a \"pack of oscillating\nmolecules\" forming sys-\n\ntems of articulation from the inside, independent of any common measure, is\nmost compel-\n\nling in view of the problem of circadian rhythms.

The definition of fuzzy aggregates brings up all kinds of problems because one cannot\n\nappeal to a local determination: \"The set of all objects on this table\" is\nobviously not a fuzzy\n\nset. Mathematicians concerned with the question speak only of \"fuzzy subsets\"\nbecause the\n\nreference set must always be an ordinary set.

In considering fuzziness as the characteristic of certain\nsets, our point of\n\ndeparture was a functional, as opposed to a local, definition: sets of\nheterogeneous elements\n\nthat have a territorial, or rather territorializing, function. But this is a\nnominal definitiion that\n\ndoes not take \"what happened\" into account. The real definition can come only\nat the level of\n\nprocesses affecting the fuzzy set; a set is fuzzy if its elements belong to it\nonly by virtue of spe-\n\ncific operations of consistency and consolidation, which themselves follow a\nspecial logic.\n\n55.

Franz\n\nRosenthal (Princeton, N J.: Princeton University Press, 1967). One of the\nessential themes of\n\nthis masterpiece is the sociological problem of the esprit de corps, and its\nambiguity. Ibn\n\nKhaldun contrasts bedouinism (the bedouin life-style, not the ethnic group)\nwith sedentarity\n\nor city living. The first aspect of this opposition is the inverted relation\nbetween the public and\n\nthe secret: not only is there a secrecy of the bedouin war machine, as opposed\nto the publicity\n\nof the State city dweller, but in the first case \"eminence\" is based on a\nsecret solidarity, while in\n\nthe second case the secret is subordinated to the demands of social eminence.\nSecond,\n\nbedouinism brings into play both a great purity and a great mobility of the\nlineages and their\n\ngenealogy, whereas city life makes for lineages that are very impure, and at\nthe same time rigid\n\nand fixed: Solidarity has a different meaning at either pole. Third, and this\nis the main point,\n\nbedouin lineages mobilize an esprit de corps and integrate into it, as a new\ndimension: this is  \n_asablyah, _or _ikhtilat, _from which the Arabic word for socialism is derived\n(Ibn Khaldun\n\nstresses the absence of any \"power\" residing in the tribal chief, who has no\nState constraints at\n\nhis disposal). On the other hand, in city living the esprit de corps becomes a\ndimension of\n\npower and is adapted for \"autocracy.\"\n\n32. The principal texts of Husserl are _Ideas, _trans. W. R.

On the issue of a vague yet\nrigorous sci-\n\nence, we may refer to the formula of Michel Serres, in his commentary on the\ngeometrical fig-\n\nure called the _salinon: _\"It is rigorous, anexact.

Gaston Bachelard's book\n_Essai sur la  \nconnaissance approch'ee _(Paris: Vrin, 1927) remains the best study of the\nsteps and procedures\n\nconstituting a rigor of the anexact, and of their creative role in science.\n\n33. Gilbert Simondon has contributed much to the analysis and critique of the\n\nhylo-morphic schema and of its social presuppositions (\"form corresponds to\nwhat the\n\nman in command has thought to himself, and must express in a positive manner\nwhen he\n\ngives his orders: form is thus of the order of the expressible\"). To the form-\nmatter schema,\n\nSimondon opposes a dynamic schema, that of matter endowed with singularities-\nforces, or\n\nthe energetic conditions at the basis of a system.

In _Timaeus, _28-29, Plato entertains for an instant the thought that Becoming is not\n\nsimply the inevitable characteristic of copies or reproductions, but could\nitself be a model\n\nrivaling the Identical and the Uniform.

Albert Lautman has shown quite clearly how Riemann spaces, for example, admit a\n\nEuclidean conjunction making it possible at all times to define the\nparallelism of two neigh-\n\nboring vectors; this being the case, instead of exploring a multiplicity by\nlegwork, the multipli-\n\ncity is treated as though \"immersed in a Euclidean space with a sufficient\nnumber of\n\ndimensions.\" See _Les sch'emas de structure _(Paris: Hermann, 1938), pp.\n23-24, 43-47.\n\n40. In Bergson, the relations between intuition and intelligence are very complex, and\n\nthey are in perpetual interaction. Bouligand's theme is also relevant here:\nthe dualism of the\n\ntwo mathematical elements, the \"problem\" and the \"global synthesis,\" is\ndeveloped only\n\nwhen they enter a field of interaction in which the global synthesis defines\nthe \"categories\"\n\nwithout which the problem would have no general solution.

Marcel Detienne, in _Les maitres de v'erit'e dans la Grece archdique _(Paris: Maspero,\n\n1973), clearly articulates these two poles of thought, which correspond to the\ntwo aspects of\n\nsovereignty according to Dumezil: the magico-religious speech of the despot or\nof the \"old\n\nman of the sea,\" and the dialogue-speech of the city. Not only are the\nprincipal character types\n\nof Greek thought (the Poet, the Physicist, the Philosopher, the Sophist, etc.)\nsituated in rela-\n\ntion to these poles, but Detienne interposes between the two poles a distinct\ngroup, the Warri-\n\nors, which brings about transition or evolution.\n\n42. There exists a Hegelianism of the right that lives on in official political philosophy\n\nand weds the destiny of thought to the State. Alexandre Kojeve (\"Tyranny and\nWisdom,\" in\n\nLeo Strauss, _On Tyranny _[New York: Free Press of Glencoe, 1963]) and Eric\nWeil _(Hegel et  \nI'Etat. Philosophiepolitique _[Paris: Vrin, 1974]) are its recent\nrepresentatives. From Hegel to\n\nMax Weber there developed a whole line of reflection on the relation of the\nmodern State to\n\nReason, both as rational-technical and as reasonable-human. If it is objected\nthat this ration-\n\nality, already present in the archaic imperial State, is the _optimum _of the\ngovernors them-\n\nselves, the Hegelians respond that the rational-reasonable cannot exist\nwithout a minimum of\n\nparticipation by everybody. The question, rather, is whether the very form of\nthe\n\nrational-reasonable is not extracted from the State, in a way that necessarily\nmakes it right,\n\ngives it \"reason\" _(lui donner necessairement \"raison\")._\n\n43.

It\nwas only after Solon\n\nthat Nomos came to designate the principle at the basis of the laws and of\nright (Thesmo'i and\n\nDike), and then came to be identified with the laws themselves. Prior to that,\nthere was instead\n\nan alternative between the city, or polis, ruled by laws, and the outskirts as\nthe place of the\n\nnomos.

Miriam Kochan (New York: Harper and\nRow, 1967),\n\npp. 97-108; Pierre Chaunu, _L'expansion europeenne du Xllle au XVe siecle\n_(Paris: PUF,\n\n1969), pp. 334-339 (\"Why Europe? Why not China?\"); Maurice Lombard, _Espaces\net reseaux  \ndu hautMoyen Age _(The Hague: Mouton, 1971), chapter 8 (and p. 219: \"What is\ncalled defor-\n\nestation in the East is named clearing in the West. The first deep cause of\nthe shift of the domi-\n\nnant centers from the East to the West is therefore a geographical reason:\nforest-clearing\n\nproved to have more potential than desert-oasis\").\n\n61. Marx's observations on the despotic formations of Asia have been confirmed by the\n\nAfrican analyses of Max Gluckman, _Custom and Conflict in Africa _(Glencoe,\n111.: Free Press,\n\n1959): at the same time immutability of form and constant rebellion. The idea\nof a \"transfor-\n\nmation\" of the State indeed seems to be a Western one. And that other idea,\nthe \"destruction\"\n\nof the State, belongs much more to the East and to the conditions of a nomad\nwar machine.\n\nAttempts have been made to present the two ideas as successive phases of\nrevolution, but\n\nthere are too many differences between them and they are difficult to\nreconcile; they reflect\n\nthe opposition between the socialist and anarchist currents of the nineteenth\ncentury. The\n\nWestern proletariat itself is perceived from two points of view: as having to\nseize power and\n\ntransform the State apparatus (the point of view of labor power), and as\nwilling or wishing for\n\nthe destruction of the State (this time, the point of view of nomadization\npower). Even Marx\n\ndefines the proletariat not only as alienated (labor) but as\ndeterritorialized. The proletariat, in\n\nthis second perspective, appears as the heir to the nomad in the Western\nworld. Not only did\n\nmany anarchists invoke nomadic themes originating in the East, but the\nbourgeoisie above all\n\nwere quick to equate proletarians and nomads, comparing Paris to a city\nhaunted by nomads\n\n(see Louis Chevalier, _Laboring Classes and Dangerous Classes in Paris during\nthe First Half of  \nthe Nineteenth Century, _trans. Frank Jellenck [New York: H. Fertig, 1973],\npp. 362-366).\n\n62. See Lucien Musset, _Les invasions.

Virilio gives a very good definition of the fleet in being and its historical conse-\n\nquences: \"The fleet in being... is the permanent presence in the sea of an\ninvisible fleet able  \nto strike no matter where and no matter when ... it is a new idea of violence\nthat no longer  \ncomes from direct confrontation... but rather from the unequal properties of\nbodies, evalu-  \nation of the number of movements allowed them in a chosen element, permanent\nverification  \nof their dynamic efficiency... .Henceforth it is no longer a question of\ncrossing a continent or  \nan ocean from one city to the next, one shore to the next. The fleet in being\ncreates ... the  \nnotion of displacement without destination in space and time.... The strategic\nsubmarine  \nhas no need to go anywhere in particular; it is content, while controlling the\nsea, to remain  \ninvisible . .. the realization of the absolute, uninterrupted, circular\nvoyage, since it involves  \nneither departure nor arrival... .If, as Lenin claimed,'strategy means\nchoosing which points  \nwe apply force to,' we must admit that these 'points', today, are no longer\ngeostrategic  \nstrongpoints, since from any given spot we can now reach any other, no matter\nwhere it might  \nbe... _geographic localization _seems to have definitively lost its strategic\nvalue, and, inversely,  \nthat this same value is attributed to the _delocalization of the vector, _of a\nvector in permanent  \nmovement\"; _Speed and Politics, _pp. 38,40-41,134-135. Virilio's texts are of\ngreat importance  \nand originality in every respect. The only point that presents a difficulty\nfor us is his assimila-  \ntion of three groups of speed that seem very different to us: (1) speeds of\nnomadic, or revolu-  \ntionary, tendency (riot, guerrilla warfare); (2) speeds that are regulated,\nconverted, appropri-  \nated by the State apparatus (management of the public ways); (3) speeds that\nare reinstated by  \na worldwide organization of total war, or planetary overarmament (from the\nfleet in being to  \nnuclear strategy). Virilio tends to equate these groups on account of their\ninteractions and  \nmakes a general case for the \"fascist\" character of speed. It is,\nnevertheless, his own analyses  \nthat make these distinctions possible.\n\n66. Jean-Pierre Vernant in particular has analyzed the connection between the Greek\n\ncity-state and a homogeneous geometrical extension, _Mythe et pensee chez les\nGrecs _(Paris:  \nMaspero, 1971 -1974), vol. 1, part 3\\. The problem is necessarily more\ncomplicated in relation  \nto the archaic empires, or in relation to formations subsequent to the\nclassical city-state. That  \nis because the space in question is very different. But it is still the case\nthat the number is sub-  \nordinated to space, as Vernant suggests with regard to Plato's ideal state.\nThe Pythagorean or  \nNeoplatonic conceptions of number envelop imperial astronomical spaces of a\ntype other  \nthan homogeneous extension, but they maintain the subordination of the number;\nthat is why  \nNumbers become _ideal, _but not strictly speaking \"numbering.\"\n\n67. Dumezil stresses the role played by the arithmetic element in the earliest forms of\n\npolitical sovereignty. He even tends to make it a third pole of sovereignty.\nSee _Servius et la For-  \ntune _and _Le troisieme souverain _(Paris: Maisonneuve, 1949). But the role of\nthis arithmetic  \nelement is, rather, to organize a matter; in so doing it submits that matter\nto one or the other of  \nthe two principal poles.\n\n68.

The term used by Vladimirtsov, \"antrustions,\" is\nborrowed from\n\nthe Saxon regime, in which the king's _company, _or \"trust,\" was composed of\nFranks.\n\n72. A particularly interesting case is that of a special body of smiths among the Tuareg,\n\ncalled the _Enaden _(the \"Others\"); the Enaden are thought to have been\noriginally Sudanese\n\nslaves, Jewish settlers in the Sahara, or descendants of the knights of Saint\nLouis. See Rene\n\nPottier, \"Les artisans sahariens du metal chez les Touareg,\" in _Techniques et\ncivilisations, _vol.\n\n1 _(M'etaux et civilisations), _no. 2 (1945), pp. 31-40.\n\n73. Feudalism is no less a military system than so-called military democracy; but both\n\nsystems assume an army integrated into some kind of State apparatus (for\nfeudalism, it was\n\nthe Carolingian land reform). It is Vladimirtsov who developed a feudal\ninterpretation of the\n\nnomads of the steppe, whereas Mikhail Griaznov, _The Ancient Civilization of\nSouthern  \nSiberia, _trans. James Hogarth (New York: Cowles, 1969), leans toward military\ndemocracy.\n\nBut one of Vladimirtsov's main arguments is that the organization of the\nnomads becomes\n\nfeudal precisely to the extent that it is in disintegration, or is integrated\ninto the empires it\n\nconquers. He himself remarks that in the beginning the Mongols did not\norganize the seden-\n\ntary land they took over into fiefs, true or false.\n\n74. J. F. C.

Paul Virilio, \"Metempsychose du passager,\" _Traverses, _no. 8 (May 1977), pp. 11-19.\n\nVirilio, however, asserts that there was an indirect transition from hunting\nto war: when\n\nwomen served as \"portage or pack\" animals, which already enabled the hunters\nto enter into a\n\nrelation of \"homosexual duel\" transcending the hunt. But it seems that Virilio\nhimself invites\n\nus to make a distinction between _speed, _as projector and projectile, and\n_displacement, _as\n\ntransport and portage. The war machine is defined from the first point of\nview, while the sec-\n\nond relates to the public sphere. The horse, for example, is not a part of the\nwar machine if it\n\nserves only to transport men who dismount to do battle. The war machine is\ndefined by\n\naction, not transport, even if the transport reacts upon the action.\n\n76. J. F. C. Fuller, _Armaments and History, _pp. 137ff., shows that the First World War\n\nwas first conceived as an offensive war of movement based on artillery. But\nartillery was\n\nturned against artillery, forcing immobility. It was not possible to reinstate\nmobility in the war\n\nthrough \"ever-increasing shell fire\" (p. 138) since the craters made the\nterrain all the harder to\n\nnegotiate. The solution, to which the English, and General Fuller in\nparticular, made decisive\n\ncontributions, came in the form of the tank: the tank, a \"landship\" (p. 139),\nreconstituted a\n\nkind of maritime or smooth space on land, and \"superimposed naval tactics on\nland warfare\"\n\n(p. 140). As a general rule, military response is never in kind: the tank was\nthe response to artil-\n\nlery, the helicopter to the tank, etc. This makes for an innovation factor in\nthe war machine\n\nthat is very different from innovation in the work machine.\n\n77. On this general distinction between the two models, \"work-free action,\" \"consum-\n\ning force/conserving force,\" \"real effect/formal effect,\" etc., see Martial\nGueroult's expo-\n\nsition, _Dynamique et metaphysique leibniziennes _(Paris: Les Belles Lettres,\n1934), pp. 55,\n\n119 ff., 222-224.\n\n78.

There are, of course, forms of cooking and architecture that are part of the nomad\n\nwar machine, but they fall under a different \"trait,\" one distinguishing them\nfrom their seden-\n\ntary form. Nomad architecture, for example, the Eskimo igloo orthe Hunnish\nwooden palace,\n\nis a derivative of the tent: its influence on sedentary art came by way of\ndomes and\n\nhalf-domes, and above all of _space starting very low, _as in a tent. As for\nnomad cooking, it\n\nconsists literally of break-fast (the paschal tradition is nomadic). And it is\nunder this trait that it\n\ncan be part of a war machine: for example, the Janissaries used a cooking pot\nas their rallying\n\npoint; there were different ranks of cooks, and their hat had a wooden spoon\nthrough it.\n\n85. Itisinthe _Trait'edu rebelle _(Paris: Bourgois, 1981) that Jiinger takes his clearest stand\n\nagainst national socialism and develops certain points contained in _Der\nArbeiter: _a concep-\n\ntion of the \"line\" as an active escape passing between the two figures of the\nold Soldier and the\n\nmodern Worker, carrying both toward another destiny in another assembly\n(nothing of this\n\nremains in Heidegger's notion of the Line, although it is dedicated to\nJiinger).\n\n86. Lynn White, Jr., who is actually not inclined to ascribe much power of innovation\n\nto the nomads, sometimes establishes extensive technological lineages with\nsurprising\n\norigins: he traces hot-air and turbine technologies to Malaya _(Medieval\nTechnology and  \nSocial Change, _p. 95 and note): \"Thus a chain of technological stimuli may be\ntraced back\n\nfrom some of the major figures of early modern science and technology through\nthe later\n\nMiddle Ages to the jungles of Malaya. A second, and related, Malay invention,\nthe fire pis-\n\nton, may have had significant influence upon the European understanding of air\npressure\n\nand its applications.\"\n\n87.

In particular, _damasking\n(damassage), _which\n\ndoes not come from Damascus at all, but rather from the Greek or Persian word\nfor diamond,\n\ndesignates the treatment of cast steel that makes it as hard as a diamond and\nthe designs in this\n\nsteel resulting from the crystallization of the cement (\"true damask was made\nin the centers\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)584.png)\n\n562 \u25a1 NOTES TO PP. 406-414\n\nthat had never experienced Roman domination\"). But on the other hand,\n_damascening  \n(damasquinage), _which did come from Damascus, designates only inlay in metal\n(or in fab-\n\nric), intentional designs imitating damasking using entirely different means.\n\n91. Andre Leroi-Gourhan, _Milieu et techniques _(Paris: Albin Michel, 1945), pp. 356ff.\n\nGilbert Simondon, discussing short series, takes up the question of the\n\"absolute origins of a\n\ntechnological lineage,\" or of the creation of a \"technical essence\": _Du mode\nd'existence des  \nobjects techniques _(Paris: Aubier, 1969), pp. 41-49.\n\n92. On the mold-modulation relation, and the way in which molding hides or contracts\n\nan operation of modulation that is essential to matter-movement, see Simondon,\n_Du mode  \nd'existence, _pp. 2 8-50 (\"modulation is molding in a continuous and\nperpetually variable man-\n\nner\"; p. 42). Simondon clearly shows that the hylomorphic schema owes its\npower not to the\n\ntechnological operation but to the social model of _work _subsuming that\noperation (pp.\n\n47-49).\n\n93. Simondon feels no special attraction for the problems of metallurgy. His analysis is\n\nnot, in fact, historical and prefers to deal with examples drawn from\nelectronics. But, histori-\n\ncally, there is no electronics without metallurgy. Thus Simondon pays homage\nto metallurgy:\n\n\"Metallurgy does not entirely accommodate itself to an analysis using the\nhylomorphic\n\nschema. The fixing of the form is not accomplished visibly in a single stroke,\nbut in several\n\nsuccessive operations; the forging and quenching of steel are anterior and\nposterior, respec-\n\ntively, to the fixing of the form in the strict sense; forging and quenching\nare, nevertheless,\n\noperations that constitute objects\" _(L'individu, _p. 59).\n\n94. Not only must myths be taken into account, but also positive history, for example,\n\nthe role of \"the brass\" in the evolution of musical form; or again, the\nconstitution of a \"metal-\n\nlic synthesis\" in electronic music (Richard Pinhas).\n\n95. Wilhelm Worringer defines Gothic art in terms of a geometrical line that is \"primi-\n\ntive\" but has taken on life. But this vitality is not organic, as it will be\nin the classical world: this\n\nline \"embodies no organic expression.. . it is nevertheless of the utmost\nvitality... .Since this\n\nline is lacking in all organic timbre, its expression of life must, as an\nexpression, be divorced\n\nfrom organic life.. . The pathos of movement which lies in this vitalized\ngeometry\u2014a pre-\n\nlude to the vitalized mathematics of Gothic architecture\u2014forces our\nsensibility to an effort\n\nunnatural to it.\" _Form in Gothic _(London: Putnam's and Sons, 1927), pp.\n41-42.\n\n96. This is one of the essential points of V. Gordon Childe's argument in _The Prehistory _\n\n_of European Civilization _(London: Cassell, 1962): the metallurgist is the\nfirst specialized arti-\n\nsan, whose sustenance is made possible by the formation of an agricultural\nsurplus. The rela-\n\ntion of the smith to agriculture has to do not only with the tools smiths\nmanufacture but also\n\nwith the food they take or receive. The Dogon myth, as analyzed in its\nvariants by Griaule, can\n\nbe seen as marking this relation, in which the smith receives or steals\ngrains, and hides them in\n\nhis mallet.\n\n97.

Clausewitz _(Paris: Gallimard, 1976), vol. 1, pp. 122-131;\n(2) the way in\n\nwhich the war of movement places the role and importance of the battle in\nquestion (as early\n\nas Marshal de Saxe, and the controversial question of the battle during the\nNapoleonic\n\nWars); (3) finally, more recently, the critique of the battle in the name of\nnuclear arms, which\n\nplay a deterrent role, with conventional forces now having a role only in\n\"testing\" or \"man-\n\neuver\"; see the Gaullist conception of the nonbattle, and Guy Brossollet,\n_Essai sur la  \nnon-bataille _(Paris: Belin, 1975). The recent return to the notion of the\nbattle cannot be\n\nexplained simply by technological factors such as the development of tactical\nnuclear arms,\n\nbut implies political considerations\u2014it is upon these that the role assigned\nto the battle (or\n\nnonbattle) in war depends.\n\n105.

Jean Robert develops this notion of an \"inversion of signs and messages\": \"In a first\n\nphase, information circulates principally from the periphery toward the\ncenter, but at a cer-\n\ntain critical point, the town begins to emit, in the direction of the rural\nworld, increasingly\n\nimperative messages\"; the town becomes an exporter _(D'ecoloniser I'espace)._\n\n15.

The two forms of _differential rent _are based on comparison. But Marx maintains the\n\nexistence of another form, unknown to the theorists (Ricardo), but with which\nthe practition-  \ners, he says, are quite familiar: _absolute rent, _based on the special\ncharacter of landed property  \nas monopoly. In effect, land is not a commodity like the others because it is\nnot reproducible at  \nthe level of a determinable aggregate. There is therefore monopoly, which is\nnot the same as  \n\"monopoly price\" (monopoly price, and the eventual corresponding rent, are\ntotally different  \nquestions). In the simplest terms, differential rent and absolute rent can be\ndistinguished in  \nthe following manner: since the price of the product is calculated on the\nbasis of the worst soil,  \nthe entrepreneur with the best soil would have a surplus profit if the latter\nwere not trans-  \nformed into differential rent accruing to the landowner; but on the other\nhand, since agricul-  \ntural surplus value is proportionally greater than industrial surplus value\n(?), the agricultural  \nentrepreneur in general would have a surplus profit if the latter were not\ntransformed into  \nabsolute rent accruing to the landowner. Rent is thus a necessary element in\nthe equalization  \nand adjustment of profit: whether it be the equalization of the agricultural\nprofit rate (differ-  \nential rent), or the equalization of this rate and the rate of industrial\nprofit (absolute rent).  \nCertain Marxist economists have proposed an entirely different schema of\nabsolute rent, but  \none that maintains Marx's necessary distinction, [\n\nTRANS\n\n:\n\nOn absolute rent, see Marx, _Capital, _\n\nvol. 3, part 6, chapter 45, pp. 895-899.]\n\n32.

Edouard Will, _Korinthiaka _(Paris: Ed.

We already find analogous figures directly\ninscribed in the\n\narchaic empires, independently of the problems of private property. For\nexample, land is dis-\n\ntributed to the functionaries in their capacity as functionaries, and they\nexploit or lease it. But\n\nif the functionary thereby receives a rent in labor or in kind from it, he\nowes the emperor a tax\n\npayable in money. Hence the necessity of \"banks,\" which, under complex\nconditions, ensure\n\nthe equivalence, conversion, and circulation of goods-money throughout the\neconomy; see\n\nGuillaume Cardascia, \"Armee et fiscalite dans la Babylone achemenide,\" in\n_Armees et  \nfiscalit'e dans le monde antique _(Paris: CNRS, 1977).\n\n34.

Marx often emphasizes the following points, particularly in his analysis of primitive\n\naccumulation: (1) Primitive accumulation precedes the mode of production and\nmakes it pos-\n\nsible. (2) It therefore implies specific action by the State and the law,\nwhich are not opposed to\n\nviolence but, on the contrary, promote it (\"These methods depend in part on\nbrute force....\n\nBut they all employ the power of the state, the concentrated and organized\nforce of society.\"  \n_Capital, _vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes [New York: Vintage, 1977], chapter 31, p.\n915). (3) This\n\nlawful violence appears first in its raw form but ceases to be conscious to\nthe degree that the\n\nmode of production becomes established; it seems to be a fact of nature pure\nand simple\n\n(\"direct extra-economic force is still of course used, but only in exceptional\ncases\"; ibid., p.\n\n899). (4) A movement such as this is explained by the particular character of\nthis violence,\n\nwhich is in no case reducible to theft, crime, or illegality (see _Notes\nsurAdolph Wagner _in  \n_Oeu-vres de Karl Marx, _\"Pleiade\" edition, vol. 2, ed. Maximilien Rubel\n[Paris: Gallimard,\n\n1968]): what is taken away from the worker is not something surface level; the\ncapitalist\n\n\"does not limit himself to taking away or stealing, but extorts the production\nof a surplus\n\nvalue, _in other words, _he first contributes to the creation of that from\nwhich he takes away....\n\nA part of the value created without the labor of the capitalist can be\nappropriated legally by\n\nthe capitalist, in other words, without violating the corresponding right to\nthe exchange of\n\ncommodities.\"\n\n40.

In his analysis of the primitive\naccumulation of  \ncapital, Maurice Dobb _(Studies in the Development of Capitalism, _rev. ed.\n[New York: Inter-  \nnational Publishers, 1964], pp. 177-186) effectively demonstrates that\nprimitive accumula-  \ntion bears not on the means of production but on \"rights or titles to wealth\"\n(p. 177; modified  \nto agree with the French translation cited by the authors), which, depending\non the circum-  \nstances, are convertible into means of production.\n\n50. See the distinction certain jurists make between Roman, \"topical,\" law, and modern,\n\n\"axiomatic,\" law of the civil-code type. We may define certain fundamental\nways in which the  \nFrench Civil Code is closer to an axiomatic than to a code: (1) the\npredominance of the  \nenunciative form over the imperative and over affective formulas (damnation,\nexhortation,  \nadmonishment, etc.); (2) the code's pretension that it forms a complete and\nsaturated rational  \nsystem; (3) but at the same time the relative independence of the\npropositions, which permit  \naxioms to be added. On these aspects, see Jean Ray, _Essai sur la structure\nlogique du code civil  \nfrancais _(Paris: Alcan, 1926). It has been established that the\nsystematization of Roman law  \ntook place very late, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\n51.

There\n\nis first of all the question of the respective independence of the axioms, and\nwhether or not the\n\nsystem is saturated, or \"strongly complete\" (sec. 14 and 15). Second, there is\nthe question of\n\n\"models of realization,\" their heterogeneity, but also their isomorphy in\nrelation to the axio-\n\nmatic system (sec. 12). Then there is the possibility of a polymorphy of\nmodels, not only in a\n\nnonsaturated system, but even in a saturated axiomatic (sec. 12, 15, and 26).\nThen, once\n\nagain, there is the question of the \"undecidable propositions\" an axiomatic\nconfronts (sec.\n\n20). Finally, there is the question of \"power,\" by which nondemonstrable\ninfinite sets exceed\n\nthe axiomatic (sec. 26 and \"the power of the continuum\"). The comparison of\npolitics to an\n\naxiomatic is based on all of these aspects.\n\n55. Lewis Mumford, \"The First Megamachine,\" Diogenes, no. 55 (July-September 1966),\n\np. 3.

Ergonomics distinguishes between \"human-machine\" systems (or work posts) and\n\n\"humans-machines\" systems (communicational aggregates composed of human and\n\nnonhuman elements). But this is not only a difference of degree; the second\npoint of view is\n\nnot a generalization of the first: \"The notion of information loses its\nanthropocentric aspect,\"\n\nand the problems are not of adaptation but of the choice of a human or\nnonhuman element\n\ndepending on the case. See Maurice de Montmollin, _Les systemes hommes-\nmachines _(Paris:\n\nPUF, 1967). The issue is no longer to adapt, even under violence, but to\nlocalize: Where is your\n\nplace? Even handicaps can be made useful, instead of being corrected or\ncompensated for. A\n\ndeaf-mute can be an essential part of a \"humans-machines\" communicational\nsystem.\n\n57. One of the basic themes of science fiction is to show how machinic enslavement com-\n\nbines with processes of subjection, but exceeds and differs from them,\nperforming a qualita-\n\ntive leap.

Historically, these have been the major problems in axiomatics: \"undecidable\" prop-\n\nositions (contradictory statements are also nondemonstrable); the powers of\ninfinite sets,\n\nwhich by nature elude axiomatic treatment (\"the continuum, for example, cannot\nbe con-\n\nceived axiomatically in its structural specificity since every axiomatization\none can give it\n\nwill rely on a denumerable model\").

The \"intuitionist\" school (Brouwer, Heytig, Griss, Bouligand, etc.) is of great impor-\n\ntance in mathematics, not because it asserted the irreducible rights of\nintuition, or even\n\nbecause it elaborated a very novel constructivism, but because it developed a\nconception of  \n_problems, _and of a _calculus of problems _that intrinsically rivals\naxiomatics and proceeds by\n\nother rules (notably with regard to the excluded middle).\n\n62.

But at the same\n\ntime, he shows that Nazism carries out the creation of domestic capital,\nstrategic construc-\n\ntion, and the building of an arms industry, which makes it rival or sometimes\neven meld with\n\nan economy of socialist leaning (\"something that seems _to _resemble the\nSwedish loans praised\n\nby Myrdal with a view to large-scale projects, but which is in fact and\nimmediately its oppo-\n\nsite, the writing of an arms economy and a war economy,\" and the corresponding\ndifference\n\nbetween \"the public works entrepreneur\" and the \"army supplier\"; pp. 668,\n674).\n\n63.

It was a question of\nshowing simultane-\n\nously: (1) that the struggle against work is not an accidental or \"marginal\"\nphenomenon in\n\ncapitalism, but one essential to the composition of capital (the growth in the\nproportion of\n\nconstant capital), and, (2) that this phenomenon engenders a new type of\nworldwide\n\nstruggle\u2014workers' struggles, popular struggles, ethnic struggles\u2014in every\ndomain.

These two aspects, the Encompassing Element and the Center, figure in Jean-Pierre\n\nVernant's analysis of space in Anaximander; _Mythe et penseee chez les Grecs\n_(Paris: Maspero,\n\n1971-1974), vol. 1, part 3. From another perspective, the entire history of\nthe desert concerns\n\nthe possibility of its becoming the encompassing element, and also of being\nrepelled, rejected\n\nby the center, as though in an inversion of movement. In a phenomenology of\nreligion like that\n\nof Van der Leeuw, the _nomos _itself does indeed appear as the encompassing-\nlimit or ground,\n\nand also as that which is repelled, excluded, in a centrifugal movement.\n\n30. Whatever interactions there may be, the \"art of the steppes\" had a specificity that was\n\ncommunicated to the migrating Germans; in spite of his many reservations about\nnomad cul-\n\nture, Rene Grousset makes this point in _The Empire of the Steppes, _trans.\nNaomi Walford\n\n(New Brunswick, N. J.: Rutgers University Press, 1970). pp. 11 -25. He notes\nthe irreducibility\n\nof Scythian art to Assyrian art, Sarmatian art to Persian art, and Hunnic art\nto Chinese art. He\n\neven points out that the art of the steppes influenced more than it borrowed\n(see in particular\n\nthe question of Ordos art and its relations to China).\n\n31. On this question of light and color, in particular in Byzantine art, see Henri Maldiney,\n\n_Regard, parole, espace, _pp. 203ff., 239ff.\n\n32. The correlation, \"haptic-close-abstract,\" was already suggested by Riegl. But it\n\nwas Worringer who developed the theme of the abstract line. Although he\nconceives of it\n\nessentially in its Egyptian form, he describes a second form in which the\nabstract assumes\n\nan intense life and an expressionist value, all the while remaining inorganic:\n_Abstraction  \nand Empathy, _chapter 5, and especially _Form in Gothic _(London: Putnam's and\nSons,\n\n1927), pp. 38-55.\n\n33.

(\"Rhythmic\n\nmarks are anterior to explicit figures.\") Worringer's position is very\nambiguous; thinking that\n\nprehistoric art is fundamentally figurative, he excludes it from Art, on the\nsame grounds as he\n\nexcludes the \"scribblings of a child\" _(Abstraction and Empathy, _pp. 51-55).\nThen he advances\n\nthe hypothesis that the cave dwellers were the \"ultimate result\" of a series\nhe says began with\n\nthe abstract (p. 130). But would not such a hypothesis force Worringer to\nrevise his conception\n\nof the abstract, and to cease identifying it with Egyptian geometricism?\n\n34. Worringer establishes an opposition between the power of repetition, which is\n\nmechanical, multiplying, and without fixed orientation, and the force of\nsymmetry, which is\n\norganic, additive, oriented, and centered. He sees this as the fundamental\ndifference between\n\nGothic ornamentation and Greek or classical ornamentation: _Form in Gothic,\n_pp. 53-55\n\n(\"The Ceaseless Melody of the Northern Line\").

On all of these points, see Georges Charriere's very intuitive book, _Scythian Art _(New\n\nYork: Alpine Fine Arts Collection, 1979), which includes a great number of\nreproductions. It\n\nis doubtless Rene Grousset who has most effectively emphasized \"slowness\" as a\ndramatic\n\npole of nomad art: _The Empire of the Steppes, _pp. 13-14.\n\n38. Dora Vallier, in her preface to the French translation of _Abstraction and Empathy _\n\n_(Abstraction et Einfuhlung _[Paris: Klincksieck, 1978]), is right to note\nWorringer and\n\nKandinsky's independence from one another, and the differences between the\nproblems they\n\nwere addressing. However, she maintains that there is still convergence and\nresonance\n\nbetween them. In a sense, all art is abstract, with the figurative springing\nfrom certain types of\n\nabstraction. But in another sense, since there are very different types of\nlines\n\n(Egyptian-geometrical, Greek-organic, Gothic-vital, etc.), the question then\nbecomes one of\n\ndetermining which line remains abstract, or realizes abstraction as such. It\nis doubtful that\n\nit is the geometrical line, since it still draws a figure, even though an\nabstract and\n\nnonrepresentative one. Rather, the abstract line is that defined by Michael\nFried in relation to\n\ncertain works by Pollock: multidirectional, with neither inside nor outside,\nform nor\n\nbackground, delimiting nothing, describing no contour, passing between spots\nor points,\n\nfilling a smooth space, stirring up a close-lying haptic visual matter that\n\"both invites the act of\n\nseeing on the part of the spectator yet gives his eye nowhere to rest once and\nfor all,\" _(Three  \nAmerican Painters _[Cambridge, Mass.: Fogg Art Museum, 1965], p. 14). In\nKandinsky\n\nhimself, abstraction is realized not so much by geometrical structures as by\nlines of march\n\nor transit that seem to recall Mongolian nomadic motifs.\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)598.png)\n\nBibliography\n\n", "![background\nimage](\\[Gilles_Deleuze,_Felix_Guattari\\]_A_Thousand_Platea\\(BookZZ.org\\)599.png)\n\nBibliography\n\n(compiled by Brian Massumi)\n\nI before an entry indicates an interview.\n\nP before an entry indicates a preface, postface, introduction, or afterword.\n\n**by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari**\n\n_English_\n\n_Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia. _Preface by Michel Foucault.\nTrans.
